Actually it {disfmarker} This {disfmarker} this maybe brings up another topic which is um {disfmarker} So we 're done with that topic . The other topic I was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Yeah , actually I {disfmarker} I was going to say we need to {pause} talk about that too ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah . Why {disfmarker} why don't we do that ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK . Um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in . Um . {pause} And they are being assembled as we speak , I hope . And I didn't bring my car today so I 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow . Um , and then the other question I was thinking about is {disfmarker} well , a couple things . First of all , if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them . So we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "and get people 's opinions on {disfmarker} on what they think of them . Um , then the other question I had is maybe we should get another wireless . Another wireless setup .

So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike , possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together . And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "So , um ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "And {disfmarker} So , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "So let 's see we {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Right ? So we could have up to nine ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "And right now we can have up to six ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Right . And we have five , we 're getting one more ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "And it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station , and then eight hundred per channel ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Oh . So yeah so the only {disfmarker} Beyond the mike {disfmarker} the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Oh , we should do it ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK . OK , so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and {disfmarker} and then just go ahead and order them ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "I don't quite understand how that {disfmarker} how that works , . If {disfmarker} So we 're not increasing the number of channels . OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "No , we 're just replacing the wired {disfmarker} the two wired that are still working ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "OK . I see ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "along with a couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with a wireless ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Three wireds work ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Basically we found {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "right ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "I {disfmarker} I guess three wireds work , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah . But we 've had more problems with that ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "And that sort of bypasses the whole {disfmarker} the whole Jimbox thing and all that ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "And so um , we {disfmarker} we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes , as long as we 're conscious about the batteries ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "That seems to be the key issue ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Everyone 's battery OK ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "I checked them this morning , they should be ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah . Um , {vocalsound} That 's the only thing with them .

They 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone {disfmarker} on the same page with that ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "SRI , really ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "They got sa apparent Well , Maybe {pause} this needs to be bleeped out ?

But anyway there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and {disfmarker} and uh {disfmarker} and NIST and UW . So . Um . But {disfmarker} but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is {disfmarker} is quite positive with the Sony ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "uh , radio - mikes . Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something , right ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Uh , no , we 're having the {disfmarker} them do it ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "No ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "So it 's so hand - soldering it , but I 'm not doing it ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "So , they {disfmarker} they charge"}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "OK . Nothing against you and your hand - soldering"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "but {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "You 've never seen my hand - soldering . But uh , a as I said they 're coming in ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Uh , OK , so that 's being done professionally and {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "I {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Yeah . I mean ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "As professionally as I guess you can get it done ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Well , it could {disfmarker} if they do a lot of it , it 's {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "I mean i it 's just their repair shop . Right ? Their maintenance people ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Well , we 'll see what it {disfmarker} it 's like ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "That {disfmarker} tha that can be quite good . Th - this {disfmarker} Yeah , OK . Good . Yeah . So let 's go with that ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "And , I mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Uh , Yeah . So , um , uh , Dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits . Uh , so he 'll be interested in what 's going on with that . I guess {disfmarker} Was {disfmarker} the decision last time was that the {disfmarker} the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ? Has that started , or is that {disfmarker} ?"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc F", "content": "Mm - hmm . Yeah . Uh , it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Right , so , the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . So I did the {disfmarker} all that last week . So all the {disfmarker} all the forms are now {pause} on the computer . And uh , then I have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the uh {pause} transcribers use different tools . And I just want to talk to Jane about how we transition to using those ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc F", "content": "Mm - hmm .

I 've already done five or six {pause} sets ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc F", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "So if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could .

Or {disfmarker} Yes , we could things we couldn't extract the {disfmarker} from the data , the hidden variables . Yes , good .

So this {disfmarker} this meeting is one of them , although I 'm not sure I can participate if I {disfmarker} You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Um , and then there are some others that menti that Morgan mentioned , like the front - end meeting {pause} and maybe a networking {pause} group meeting ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Right .

They {disfmarker} they clearly did actually remove {pause} silent sections in order {disfmarker} because they {pause} got these {pause} word error rate {pause} results .

Whereas to whether this would actually be in a final standard , I don't know . Um . Uh , as you know , part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the {pause} word models are pretty bad and nobody wants {disfmarker} {pause} has {disfmarker} has approached improving them . So {pause} it 's possible that a lot of the problems {pause} with so many insertions and so forth would go away if they were better word models {pause} to begin with . So {pause} this might just be a temporary thing . But {disfmarker} But , on the other hand , and maybe {disfmarker} maybe it 's a decent idea . So um The question we 're gonna wanna go {pause} through next week when Hynek shows up I guess is given that we 've been {disfmarker} if you look at what we 've been trying , we 're uh looking at {pause} uh , by then I guess , combinations of features and multi - band Uh , and we 've been looking at {pause} cross - language , cross {pause} task {pause} issues . And they 've been not so much looking at {pause} the cross task uh multiple language issues . But they 've been looking at uh {disfmarker} {pause} at these issues . At the on - line normalization and the uh {pause} voice activity detection . And I guess when he comes here we 're gonna have to start deciding about {pause} um what do we choose {pause} from what we 've looked at {pause} to um blend with {pause} some group of things in what they 've looked at And once we choose that , {pause} how do we split up the {pause} effort ? Uh , because we still have {disfmarker} even once we choose , {pause} we 've still got {pause} uh another {pause} month or so , I mean there 's holidays in the way , but {disfmarker} but uh {pause} I think the evaluation data comes January thirty - first so there 's still a fair amount of time {pause} to do things together it 's just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two sites {pause} in that {disfmarker} that amount of time ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "When they removed the silence frames , did they insert some kind of a marker so that the recognizer knows it 's {disfmarker} {pause} knows when it 's time to back trace or something ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Well , see they , I {disfmarker} I think they 're Um .

Yes ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "so we treated the th first thirteen as though they were {vocalsound} standard features ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Yes . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "I mean , did Dan do experiments like that to {disfmarker} ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Uh . Talk with Stephane .

But my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but it didn't make it worse ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "But , again , given all these differences , maybe it 's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these low - variance , uh , components ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Cuz in a sense , the net 's already got quite a bit of context in those features ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "so if we did deltas and double - deltas on top of those , we 're getting sort of even more ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Which could be good or not ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . Worth trying ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "But there the main point is that , um , you know , it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems {vocalsound} debugged now and {disfmarker} I mean , there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features {disfmarker} uh , either generating them or feeding them to this {disfmarker} to the {vocalsound} SRI system ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mm - hmm .

It 's indirect , so you don't know {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "So wha w what {disfmarker} an and you may not be in this case , come to think of it , because , uh , you 're just taking something that 's trained up elsewhere . So , what {disfmarker} what you {disfmarker} what you do in the full procedure {vocalsound} is you , um , uh , have an embedded training . So in fact you {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the net is trained on , uh , uh , a , uh , Viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system .

You can prove that it 's {disfmarker} it 's a , uh {disfmarker} If you believe in the Viterbi assumption that , uh , getting the best path , uh , is almost equivalent to getting the best , uh , total probability , um , then you actually do improve that by , uh {disfmarker} by training up on local {disfmarker} local , uh {disfmarker} local frames .

Another thing is since you 're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation , it 's probably bigger than it needs to be ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "So that would save a lot of time ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "And there 's a mismatch in the phone sets .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "The other thing , uh , just to mention that Stephane {disfmarker} this was an innovation of Stephane 's , which was a pretty neat one , uh , and might particularly apply {vocalsound} here , given all these things we 're mentioning . Um , Stephane 's idea was that , um , discriminant , uh , approaches are great . Even the local ones , given , you know , these potential outer loops which , you know , you can convince yourself turn into the global ones . Um , however , there 's times when it {pause} is not good .

No , but we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when we {disfmarker} when I first started corresponding with Dan about how to go about this , I think that was one of the things that we definitely went there ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "or {disfmarker} ? Oh . That makes a lot of sense . Huh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . I mean , I 'm sure that Stephane wasn't the first to think of it ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "but actually Stephane did it"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Uh - huh . And i does it help ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and {disfmarker} and it helped a lot ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Oh , OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Yeah .

OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Yeah . That makes sense ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "And do you do a KLT transform on the con on the combined feature vector ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "As {disfmarker} you should never do worse ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "I {disfmarker} I , uh , missed what you said ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Do you {disfmarker} d you do a KLT transform on the combined feature vector ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Well , actually , I , uh {disfmarker} you should check with him , because he tried several different combinations ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Because you end up with this huge feature vector , so that might be a problem , a unless you do some form of dimensionality reduction ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Yeah . I , uh , th what I don't remember is which came out best .

So um recall the basic problem which is that um you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node . Right ? So as we discussed specifying this kind of thing is a big pain and it 's so will take a long time to write down because for example if these S have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have two hundred and forty - three possibilities which is already a lot of numbers to write down . So what um helps us in our situation is that these all have values in the same set , right ? These are all like saying EV or A , right ? So it 's not just a generalized situation like I mean basically we wanna just take a combination of {disfmarker} we wanna view each of these as experts ea who are each of them is making a decision based on some factors and we wanna sort of combine their decisions and create you know , um sorta weighted combination ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Hmm .

All of their outputs combined to make a decision ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . So the problem is to specify the uh so the conditional property of this given all those , right ? That 's the way belief - nets are defined , like each node given its parents , right ? So um that 's what we want , we want for example P of um let 's call this guy Y and let 's call these X - one , X - two XN , right . So we want probability that Y equals , you know , for example um E given that these guys are I 'll just refer to this as like X um hat or something , uh the co like all of them ? Given that for example the data says you know , A , V , A , E , or something right ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "So we would like to do this kind of combination ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Alright , so um Is that uh I {disfmarker} yeah , I just wanna make sure everybody is with us before he goes on ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "I think so , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "It 's {disfmarker} it 's cl e is {disfmarker} is it clear what he wants to compute ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right . So , right . So Basically um {vocalsound} what we don't wanna do is to for every single combination of E and V and A and every single letter E , s give a number"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "because that 's obviously not desirable . What we wanna do is find some principled way of um saying what each of these is and we want it to be a valid probability distribution , so we want it to um add up to one , right ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "So those are the two things that we uh need . So what uh I guess , what Jerry suggested earlier was basically that we , you know view these guys as voting and we just take the uh we essentially take um averages , right ? So for example here two people have voted for A , one has voted for V , and one has voted for E , so we could say that the probabilities are , you know , probability of being E is one over four , because one person voted for E out of four and similarly , probability of so this is probability of E s and then probability of A given all that is um two out of four and probability of V is one out of four . Right ? So that 's step {disfmarker} that 's the uh yeah that 's the {disfmarker} that 's the basic uh thing . Now"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Um Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Is that all OK ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "And that one outcome , that 's"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "What ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "it 's X {disfmarker} X - one voted for A X - two voted for V"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "and so forth ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Y right . Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "S so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this sort of things , which may or may not be a good assumption ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "That 's the outcome ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm . Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "so that"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . So step two is um right . So we 've assumed equal weights whereas it might turn out that you know , some w be that for example , what the um the actual the uh verbal content of what the person said , like what uh what might be uh somehow more uh important than the uh"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "X - one matters more i than X - two or"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right . Sure , so we don't wanna like give them all equal weight so currently we 've been giving them all weight one fourth so we could replace this by uh W - one , W - two , W - three , and W - four"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "right ? And in order for this to be a valid probability distribution for each um X - hat , we just need that the W 's sum to one . So they can be for example , you know you {disfmarker} you could have point one , point three , point two , and point four , say ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "That 's one ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "And that 'd be one . So that um also seems to work fine . And uh"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "So I jus just to make sure I understand this , so in this case um we would still compute the average ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "You 'd compute the weighted average , so the probability of E would be uh"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK , so {disfmarker} so it 'd be so in this case the probability that Y equals A would be uh {comment} W one times {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Point three ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "or A or {disfmarker} let 's see , one full quarter times point one"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Not one quarter ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "so these numbers have been replaced with point one , point three , point two , and point four . So you can view these as gone ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Probability of"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . OK . So , alright . So this is uh step two . So the next possibility is that um we 've given just a single weight to each expert , right , whereas it might be the case that um in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable . So the way this is handled is by what 's called a mixture of experts , so what you can have is you augment these diagrams like this so you have a new thing called \" H \" , OK ? This is a hidden variable . And what this is is it gets its input from X - one , X - two , X - three , and X - four , and what it does is it decides which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation . Right ? And then these guys all come here . OK . So this is sightly uh more complicated . So what 's going on is that um this H node looks at these four values of those guys and it decides in given these values which of these isn't likely to be more reliable or most reliable . So H produces some you know , it produces a number , either one , two , three , or four , in our situation , right ? Now this guy he looks at the value of H say it 's two , and then he just selects the uh thing . That 's all there is to say , I guess about it . Right , so you can have a mixture that"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "So {disfmarker} so the function of the thing that comes out of H is very different from the function of the other inputs . It 's driving how the other four are interpreted . OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "So H passes a vector on to the next node ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "It could ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "It could ? A vector of the weights as the se"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah , it could"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "oh ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Sorry ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Well a vector with three zero 's and one one , right ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Oh it 's basically to tell the bottom node which one of the situations that it 's in or which one of the weighting systems"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right , so I mean the way you desc"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "W I was just , if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too , couldn't you ? OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Um Does H have to have another input to tell it alpha , beta , whatever , or is the {disfmarker} that 's determined by what the experts are saying , like the type of situ OK . Hmm . OK . OK . I mean It {disfmarker} it just seems that like without that {disfmarker} that outside input that you 've got a situation where , you know , like if {disfmarker} if uh X - one says no , you know , a low value coming out of X - on or i if X - one says no then ignore X - one , you know , I mean that seems like that 'd be weird ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah , well could be things like if X - two and X - three say yes then i ignore X - one also ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "right ? Oh , OK . OK . Alright , right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Oh The situations that H has , are they built into the net or OK , so they {disfmarker} they could either be hand coded or learned or OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Based on training data , OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "So you specify one of these things for every one of those possi possible situations . Oh yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Um Well , I mean to learn them we need data , where are we gonna get data ? Well I mean we need data with people intentions , right ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Right , right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Which is slightly tricky . Right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mm - hmm . But what 's the data about like , are we able to get these nodes from the data ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Like how thrifty the user is , or do we have access to that ? Mm - hmm .

OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah , but that 's my question , like how do we {disfmarker} I mean , how do we have data about something like um um endpoint sub - E , or endpoint sub uh {pause} you know s S ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Well , basically you would say , based on {disfmarker} in this dialogue that we have which one of the things that they said eh whether it was the entity relations or whatever was the thing that determined what mode it was ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mmm . Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "right ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "So this is what we wanna learn . Yep . Right . Hmm . Yeah . I don't think , well you have a {disfmarker} can you bring up the function thing ? Um w where is the thing that allows you to sort of"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "That 's on the added variable , isn't it ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Oh function properties , is that it ? Hmm , I guess not . Yeah , that 's"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right . OK . And um it so e either it 'll allow us to do everything which I think is unlikely , I think more likely it 'll allow us to do very few of these things and in that case we 'll have to um just write up little things that allow you to um create such CPU 's on your own in the java base format . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do because yeah I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do , it 's Right . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Ah . Well in terms of java base I think it 's basically what you see is what you get in I don't yeah , I would be surprised if it supports anything more than what we have right here ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "So Yeah . Yeah . By the way um uh just talking about uh about that general end of things uh is there gonna be data soon from what people say when they 're interacting with the system and so on ? Like , I mean , what kind of questions are being given {disfmarker} being asked ? Cuz {disfmarker} OK . Yeah yeah . OK . OK . Fey , you mean . OK . OK . O OK . OK . I 'm just wondering , because in terms of , you know , I mean uh w the figure {disfmarker} I was thinking about this figure that we talked about , fifty constructions or whatever that 's uh that 's a whole lot of constructions and um you know , I mean one might be f fairly pleased with getting a really good analysis of five maybe ten in a summer so , I mean I know we 're going for sort of a rough and ready . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . OK . OK . I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was {disfmarker} uh I was talking about the , you know , if you wanted to do it really in detail and we don't really need all the detail for what we 're doing right now but anyway in terms of just narrowing that task you know which fifty do I do , I wanna see what people are using , so Well , it will inspire me .

And he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , {vocalsound} run things using P - make and Customs . You don't actually have to write P - make scripts and things like that . The simplest thing {disfmarker} And I can send an email around or , maybe I should do an FAQ on the web site about it or something .

And , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and uh {disfmarker} and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . So you can try this as a simple test with uh , the L S command . So you can say \" run dash command L S \" , and , um , it 'll actually export that {vocalsound} LS command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an LS on your current directory . So , substitute LS for whatever command you want to run , and um {disfmarker} And that 's a simple way to get started using {disfmarker} using this . And , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , {vocalsound} um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . Now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it . Uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like \" run command \" , you can specify those attributes for your program . For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux , you can give it the Linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that . So . You can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that . If there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . So , there 's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh , right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it and we 're {disfmarker} Uh .

So , I 've been , uh , looking into , um , doing something about r uh , speech recognition using acoustic events .

Um , and , um , these {disfmarker} these primary detectors , um , will be , uh , inspired by , you know , multi - band techniques , um , doing things , um , similar to Larry Saul 's work on , uh , graphical models to {disfmarker} to detect these {disfmarker} these , uh , acoustic events .
