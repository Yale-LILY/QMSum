Low-pass seemed to perform better, but the team was uncertain about its robustness. The professor thought that the team should submit something to Eurospeech and that they should further study reverberation.

But uh Dan is pretty confident that we 're not , that {disfmarker} that quantization error is not {disfmarker} is still not a significant {vocalsound} factor there . So .

I think the reason is , yeah , I not I {disfmarker} it was in my mail I think also , {vocalsound} is the fact that the mismatch is trained only on the far microphone .

Yes ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "I did one quick experiment just to make sure I had everything worked out and I just {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh f for most of the um {disfmarker} For {disfmarker} for all of the digit models , they end up at three mixtures per state .

Uh so I 'm r gonna run that again but {vocalsound} um with many more uh mixtures per state ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah . Cuz at forty thou I mean you could you could have uh {disfmarker} Yeah , easily four times as many {vocalsound} parameters ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm .

Yeah , and it 's hard to improve on the {disfmarker} on the best case , cuz it 's already so good , right ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah but {pause} what I mean is that you can have a huge improvement on the H {disfmarker} HMK 's , uh like five percent uh absolute , and this will not affect the final score almost {disfmarker} Uh this will almost not affect the final score because {vocalsound} this improvement {disfmarker} because the improvement {vocalsound} uh relative to the {disfmarker} the baseline is small {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So they do improvement in terms of uh accuracy ? rather than word error rate ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Uh . Uh improvement ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "No , it 's compared to the word er it 's improvement on the word error rate ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "yeah . Sorry ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So if you have uh ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh {vocalsound} improvement then that 's fifty percent ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "OK . So what you 're saying then is that if it 's something that has a small word error rate , {vocalsound} then uh a {disfmarker} even a relatively small improvement on it , in absolute terms , {vocalsound} will show up as quite {disfmarker} quite large in this ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Is that what you 're saying ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "OK .

Sure , but when we think about the weighting , which is point five , point three , point two , {vocalsound} it 's on absolute on {disfmarker} on relative figures ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "not {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "So when we look at this error rate"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "No . That 's why I 've been saying we should be looking at word error rate uh and {disfmarker} and not {disfmarker} not at {vocalsound} at accuracies ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "uh {disfmarker} Mmm , yeah . Mmm , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "It 's {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "I mean uh we probably should have standardized on that all the way through . It 's just {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Well ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "I mean , it 's not {disfmarker} it 's not that different , right ? I mean , just subtract the accuracy ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Yeah but you 're {disfmarker} but when you look at the numbers , your sense of the relative size of things is quite different ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "I mean {disfmarker} Oh . Oh , I see . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "If you had ninety percent uh correct {vocalsound} and five percent , five over ninety doesn't look like it 's a big difference , but {vocalsound} five over ten is {disfmarker} is big ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "So just when we were looking at a lot of numbers and {vocalsound} getting sense of what was important ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "I see .

So it 's around , like , point five . No , point six {comment} uh percent absolute on Italian {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Worse ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Worse , yep ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Out of what ?

Uh , do you know what pie"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah . I guess {disfmarker} I guess it 's {disfmarker} it 's the filter .

There is first this thing , and then the {disfmarker} yeah , I computed the um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} like , the confidence level on the different test sets .

Do the {disfmarker} does the new filter make things uh better or worse for the other cases ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah . But . Uh . About the same . It doesn't hurt . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Doesn't hurt , but doesn't get a little better , or something ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "No . OK , so {vocalsound} um I guess the argument one might make is that , \" Yeah , if you looked at one of these cases {vocalsound} and you jiggle something and it changes {vocalsound} then uh you 're not quite sure what to make of it . But when you look across a bunch of these and there 's some {disfmarker} some pattern , um {disfmarker} I mean , so eh h here 's all the {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if in all these different cases {vocalsound} it never gets better , and there 's significant number of cases where it gets worse , {vocalsound} then you 're probably {pause} hurting things , {vocalsound} I would say . So um {vocalsound} I mean at the very least that would be a reasonably prediction of what would happen with {disfmarker} with a different test set , that you 're not jiggling things with .

The {disfmarker} the other thing I was suggesting , though , is that given that you 're talking about binary features , uh , maybe the first thing to do is just to count and uh count co - occurrences and get probabilities for a discrete HMM cuz that 'd be pretty simple because it 's just {disfmarker} Say , if you had ten {disfmarker} ten events , uh that you were counting , uh each frame would only have a thousand possible values for these ten bits , and uh so you could make a table that would {disfmarker} say , if you had thirty - nine phone categories , that would be a thousand by thirty - nine , and just count the co - occurrences and divide them by the {disfmarker} the uh {disfmarker} uh uh occ uh count the co - occurrences between the event and the phone and divide them by the number of occurrences of the phone , and that would give you the likelihood of the {disfmarker} of the event given the phone .

So we 're gonna try to finish by five so people who want to can go hear Nancy Chang 's talk , uh downstairs ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "And you guys are g giving talks on tomorrow and Wednesday lunch times ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "right ? That 's great . OK so , do y do you know what we 're gonna do ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "I thought two things uh we 'll introduce ourselves and what we do . And um we already talked with Andreas , Thilo and David and some lines of code were already written today and almost tested and just gonna say we have um again the recognizer to parser thing where we 're working on and that should be no problem and then that can be sort of developed uh as needed when we get {disfmarker} enter the tourism domain . em we have talked this morning with the {disfmarker} with Tilman about the generator ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "S"}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "and um There one of our diligent workers has to sort of volunteer to look over Tilman 's shoulder while he is changing the grammars to English"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "because w we have {disfmarker} we face two ways . Either we do a syllable concatenating um grammar for the English generation which is sort of starting from scratch and doing it the easy way , or we simply adopt the ah um more in - depth um style that is implemented in the German system and um are then able not only to produce strings but also the syntactic parse uh not parse not the syntactic tree that is underneath in the syntactic structure which is the way we decided we were gonna go because A , it 's easier in the beginning"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "and um it does require some {disfmarker} some knowledge of {disfmarker} of those grammars and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and some ling linguistic background .

Johno , are you gonna have some time t to do that uh w with these guys ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Sure ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "cuz y you 're the grammar maven ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "I mean it makes sense ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "doesn't it ? Yeah Good . OK . So , I think that 's probably the {disfmarker} the right way to do that . And an Yeah , so I {disfmarker} I actually wanna f to find out about it too , but I may not have time to get in ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "the {disfmarker} the ultimate goal is that before they leave we {disfmarker} we can run through the entire system input through output on at least one or two sample things .

OK , so that 's {disfmarker} Sort of one branch is to get us caught up on what 's going on . Also of course it would be really nice to know what the plans are , in addition to what 's sort of already in code ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "and we can d I dunno w w was there uh a time when we were set up to do that ?

OK well yeah maybe we 'll see if David could make it . That would be good ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "OK so facing to {disfmarker} to what we 've sort of been doing here um well for one thing we 're also using this room to collect data ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah obviously ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "um um Not this type of data ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Oh , OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "no not meeting data but sort of {disfmarker} sort ah our version of a wizard experiment such not like the ones in Munich but pretty close to it ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "The major difference to the Munich ones is that we do it via the telephone"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "even though all the recording is done here and so it 's a {disfmarker} sort of a computer call system that gives you tourist information"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "tells you how to get places .

For example um we have first looked at a simple sentence that \" How do I get to the Powder - Tower ? \" OK so you have the {disfmarker} castle of Heidelberg"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "and there is a tower and it 's called Powder - Tower ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Oh , OK . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "and um so What will you parse out of that sentence ?

And um we 've sort of gone through that once before in the Deep Mail project and we noticed that first of all what are {disfmarker} I should 've brought some slides , but what our {disfmarker} So here 's the tower . Think of this as a two - dimensional representation of the tower . And our system led people here , to a point where they were facing a wall in front of the tower . There is no entrance there , but it just happens to be the closest point of the road network to the geometric center Because that 's how the algorithm works . So we took out that part of the road network as a hack and then it found actually the way to the entrance . which was now the closest point of the road network to"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "OK , geometric center . But what we actually observed in Heidelberg is that most people when they want to go there they actually don't want to enter , because it 's not really interesting .

Does he wanna go there to see it ? Does he wanna go there now ? Later ? How does the person wanna go there ? Is that person more likely to want to walk there ? Walk a scenic route ? and so forth . There are all kinds of decisions that we have identified in terms of getting to places and in terms of finding information about things . And we are constructing {disfmarker} and then we 've identified more or less the extra - linguistic parameters that may f play a role . Information related to the user and information related to the situation . And we also want to look closely on the linguistic information that what we can get from the utterance . That 's part of why we implant these intentions in the data collection to see whether people actually phrase things differently whether they want to enter in order to buy something or whether they just wanna go there to look at it . And um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and a belief - net for a module that actually tries to guess what the underlying intention {pause} was . And then enrich or augment the M - three - L structures with what it thought what more it sort of got out of that utterance . So if it can make a good suggestion , \" Hey ! \" you know , \" that person doesn't wanna enter . That person just wants to take a picture , \" cuz he just bought film , or \" that person wants to enter because he discussed the admission fee before \" . Or \" that person wants to enter because he wants to buy something and that you usually do inside of buildings \" and so forth . These ah these types of uh these bits of additional information are going to be embedded into the M - three - L structure in an {disfmarker} sort of subfield that we have reserved . And if the action planner does something with it , great . If not you know , then that 's also something um that we can't really {disfmarker} at least we {comment} want to offer the extra information .

That information , and also about the Uh , what we 're calling \" the entity \" , Is it a castle , is it a bank ? Is it a s town square , is it a statue ? Whatever .

Um , so , I 've be just been looking at , um , Ack ! What are you doing ? Yeah . OK . Um , I 've been looking at the PRM stuff . Um , so , this is , sort of like the latest thing I have on it , and I sorta constructed a couple of classes . Like , a user class , a site class , and {disfmarker} and you know , a time , a route , and then {disfmarker} and a query class . And I tried to simplify it down a little bit , so that I can actually um , look at it more . It 's the same paper that I gave to Jerry last time . Um , so basically I took out a lot of stuff , a lot of the decision nodes , and then tried to {disfmarker} The red lines on the , um , graph are the um , relations between the different um , classes . Like , a user has like , a query , and then , also has , you know um , reference slots to its preferences , um , the special needs and , you know , money , and the user interest . And so this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes - net that I have , you know , with the input nodes and all that . And {disfmarker} So I tried to construct the dependency models , and a lot of these stuff I got from the flat Bayes - net , and what they depend on , and it turns out , you know , the CPT 's are really big , if I do that , so I tried to see how I can do , um {disfmarker} put in the computational nodes in between . And what that would look like in a PRM . And so I ended up making several classes {disfmarker} Actually , you know , a class of {disfmarker} with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes , and one of them is like , time affordability money affordability , site availability , and the travel compatibility . And so some of these classes are {disfmarker} s some of these attributes only depend on stuff from , say , the user , or s f just from , I don't know , like the site . S like , um , these here , it 's only like , user , but , if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors , you need to look at a pair of , you know , what the um , preference of the user is versus , you know , what type of an event it is , or you know , which form of transportation the user has and whether , you know , the onsite parking matters to the user , in that case . And that makes the scenario a little different in a PRM , because , um , then you have one - user objects and potentially you can have many different sites in {disfmarker} in mind . And so for each of the site you 'll come up with this rating , of travel compatibility . And , they all depend on the same users , but different sites , and that makes a {disfmarker} I 'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that . And so , I guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes - net , cuz otherwise you would {disfmarker} c well , it 's probably the same . But um , No , you would definitely have {disfmarker} be able to re - use , like , {vocalsound} um , all the user stuff , and not {disfmarker} not having to recompute a lot of the stuff , because it 's all from the user side . So if you changed sites , you {disfmarker} you can , you know , save some work on that . But , you know , in the case where , it depends on both the user and the site , then I 'm still having a hard time trying to see how um , using the PRM will help . Um , so anyhow , using those intermediate nodes then , this {disfmarker} this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes . And that would {disfmarker} basically it 's just another class in the model , with , you know , references to the user and the site and the time . And then , after you group them together this {disfmarker} no the dependencies would {disfmarker} of the queries would be reduced to this . And so , you know , it 's easier to specify the CPT and all . Um , so I think that 's about as far as I 've gone on the PRM stuff ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Well"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "No . So y you didn't yet tell us what the output is ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "The output ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "So what decisions does this make ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "OK . So it only makes two decisions , in this model . And one is basically how desirable a site is meaning , um , how good it matches the needs of a user . And the other is the mode of the visit , whether th It 's the EVA decision . Um , so , instead of um , {vocalsound} doing a lot of , you know , computation about , you know , which one site it wants of {disfmarker} the user wants to visit , I 'll come {disfmarker} well , try to come up with like , sort of a list of sites . And for each site , you know , where {disfmarker} h how {disfmarker} how well it fits , and basically a rating of how well it fits and what to do with it . So . Anything else I missed ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "So that was pretty quick . She 's ac uh uh Eva 's got a little write - up on it that uh , probably gives the {disfmarker} the details to anybody who needs them .

So w Anyway . So that 's a {disfmarker} a major open issue . If there is an interpreter , it looks like you know , what Eva 's got should run and we should be able to actually um , try to solve , you know , the problems , to actually take the data , and do it . Uh , and we 'll see . Uh , I actually think it is cleaner , and the ability to instantiate , you know , instance of people and sites and stuff , um , will help in the expression .

So that was one of the main reasons for doing it . Um . I don't know . So , uh , people who have thought about the problem , like Robert i it looked to me like if {comment} Eva were able to come up with a {vocalsound} you know , value for each of a number of uh , sites plus its EVA thing , that a travel planner should be able to take it from there .

Then , we can move on and see what Andreas has got out his sleeve . Or Andy , for that matter ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK . So uh , uh , well , thanks for having me here , first of all . Um , so maybe just a {disfmarker} a little background on {disfmarker} on my visit . So , uh , I 'm not really involved in any project , that 's uh {disfmarker} that 's relevant to you uh , a at the moment , uh , the {disfmarker} the reason is really for me uh , to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field . And {disfmarker} and so I 'll just n sort of give you a real quick introduction to what I 'm working on , and um , I just hope that you have some comments or , maybe you 're interested in it to find out more , and {disfmarker} and so I 'll be uh , happy to talk to you and {disfmarker} and uh , I 'd also like to find out some more and {disfmarker} and maybe I 'll just walk around the office and and then {disfmarker} and ask some {disfmarker} some questions , uh , in a couple days . So I 'll be here for uh , tomorrow and then uh , the remainder of uh , next week . OK , so , um , what I started looking at , uh , to begin with is just uh , content management systems uh , i i in general . So um , uh what 's uh {disfmarker} Sort of the state of the art there is to um {disfmarker} uh you have a bunch of {disfmarker} of uh documents or learning units or learning objects , um , and you store meta - data uh , associate to them . So there 's some international standards like the I - triple - E , uh {disfmarker} There 's an I - triple - E , LON standard , and um , these fields are pretty straightforward , you have uh author information , you have uh , size information , format information and so on . Uh , but they 're two uh fields that are um , more interesting . One is uh you store keywords associated with the uh {disfmarker} with the document , and one is uh , you have sort of a , um , well , what is the document about ? So it 's some sort of taxonomic uh , ordering of {disfmarker} of the {disfmarker} of the units . Now , if you sort of put on your semantic glasses , uh you say , well that 's not all that easy , because there 's an implicit um , uh , assumption behind that is that uh , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of uh , whichever taxonomy is used , and uh , I think that 's a {disfmarker} that 's a very {disfmarker} that 's a key point of these systems and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that and uh {disfmarker} As a matter of fact , the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes , which are very , very coarse grain , so you have some like , science , biology , and then {disfmarker} But that 's really all that we have at the moment . So I think there 's a huge , um , uh need for improvement there . Now , what this uh {disfmarker} a standard like this would give us is we could um , sort of uh with a search engine just query uh , different repositories all over the world . But we can't really {disfmarker} Um , so what I 'm {disfmarker} what I try to do is um , to have um , uh {disfmarker} So . So the scenario is the following , you you 're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem . Now , what {disfmarker} what we have at our university quite a bit is that uh , students um , try to u program a certain assignment , for example , they always run into the same problems , uh , and they always come running to us , and they 'll say why 's it not {disfmarker} it 's not working , and we always give out the same answer , so we thought , well , it 'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this , and so , what I want to build is basically a {disfmarker} a smart F A Q system . Now , what you uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information which is more elaborate than \" I 'm looking for this and this and this keyword . \" So . And I think that I don't need to tell you this . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sure you have the same {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when somebody utters a sentence in a certain , uh , context it , and {disfmarker} and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference . So , I want to be able to model information like , um , so in the {disfmarker} in the context of {disfmarker} in the context of developing distributed systems , of a at a computer science school , um , what kind of software is the person using , which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment , um , maybe what 's the background of that student 's um , which um , which error message was encountered . So this sort of information I think should be transmitted , uh , when a certain document is retrieved . Now , um , basically giving this um {disfmarker} Uh so we somehow need to have a formalized um , way of writing this down basically , and that 's where the shared interpretation of {disfmarker} of certain terms and keywords comes in again . And , using this and some {disfmarker} some uh , knowledge about the domain I think you can do some {disfmarker} some simple inferences . Like you know that when somebody 's working about {disfmarker} uh , working on {disfmarker} on servlets for example , he 's using Java , cuz servlets are used {disfmarker} are written in Java . So some {disfmarker} some inferences like that , now , um , u using this you can infer more information , and you could then match this to the meta - data of um {disfmarker} off the documents you 're {disfmarker} you 're searching against . So , uh what I wanna do is basically have some sort of um {disfmarker} given these inputs , and then I can compute how many documents match , and use this as a metric in the search . Now , what I plan to do is I want to uh sort of do a uh {disfmarker} uh {pause} try to improve the quality of the search results , and I want to do this by having a depth uh , um , um {disfmarker} steepest descent approach . So if I knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ? And {disfmarker} and having uh , uh a symbolic formalized model of this I could simply compute that , and find out which um {disfmarker} which questions are worth um , asking . And that 's what I then propagate back to the user , and {disfmarker} and sort of try to optimize the search in this way . Now , the big problem that I 'm facing right now is um , it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly , that {disfmarker} that works in the small domain , but the problem is obviously the scalability . And uh uh , so Robert was mentioning uh , earlier today is that uh , Microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a Bayesian network , which does exactly this , but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend . And so , uh what I 'm {disfmarker} What I try to do is basically try to model this uh , in a way that you could really combine uh , knowledge from very different sources , and {disfmarker} and um , sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh , came up with . Trying to {disfmarker} to have uh , an approach how to integrate s uh certain uh {disfmarker} representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules , um , what you can do with those . Um . What I 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure , so it 's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic uh , computational model . That {disfmarker} that probably isn't expressive enough . So . So that 's another thing , um , which I think you 're also uh , uh looking into right now . And then um , uh sort of as an add - on to this whole idea , um , uh that would be now , depending on what the search engine or the content repository {disfmarker} depending on which {disfmarker} um , uh , which uh , rules and which ontologies it {disfmarker} it uses , or basically its view of the world , uh you can get very different results . So it might ma make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines . And there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a {disfmarker} a peer to peer approach , where we 're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves , and um , if you have a question about a homework , it 's {disfmarker} probably makes sense to ask somebody who 's in your class with you , sort of the guru in the certain area , rather than going to some Yahoo - like uh , search engine . So these are some of the {disfmarker} just in a nutshell , some of the ideas . And I think a lot of the {disfmarker} even though it 's a {disfmarker} it 's a very different domain , but I think a lot of the , um , issues are {disfmarker} are fairly similar . So . OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "And so some of the {disfmarker} I don't know how much you know about the larger Heidelberg project , I {disfmarker} Are you {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Uh I know , yeah I know abou about it ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "So it seems like a lot of {disfmarker} some of the issues are the same .

So \" this document explains how to set up your uh , mail account on Linux \" or something like this ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "So .

One branch approved it ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "and , um , yesterdayday {comment} there was this uh {disfmarker} uh I thought that the other branch would just approve it , but now there 's actually a little back sliding to people who {disfmarker} who approved it got flak from there , eh anyway . So , um {disfmarker} Oh ! I have to tell you a wonderful story about this , OK ? And then we 'll go . So , I {disfmarker} it turns out I wound up having lunch today with a guy named Tom Kalil . KILL {disfmarker} KALIL . And , uh , he now works at Berkeley . In fact he 's hired to run a lot of CITRIS , even though we don't have the money they {disfmarker} So they 've been hiring people right and left , so , uh , they think the money 's coming . So {disfmarker} and he was , I think , the chief staffer to Clinton on technology matters . He was in the White House , I don't remember what he was saying . A anyway , like that . And , is now doing all the politics for CITRIS , but also , has a uh , a lot of interest in uh , actually doing things for society , so digital divide and stuff like that . So that 's s interesting to me but maybe not to you . But the really interesting thing was , he st he s he s said something about , you know I 'm interested in things that have high social multiplier , something that is of great social value . He said , \" for example \" , this was his only example , \" if you had a adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor , and as compelling as a video game , then that would have a huge social impact \" . I said , \" Oh great ! That 's a good problem to work on . \" Anyway . So it was nice that uh , he 's got this view , of A , that 's what you should try to do , and B , uh , language would be a good way to do it ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mmm . Definitely ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "So that 's {disfmarker} So anyway , that 's the end of the story ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "But for adults and not for the children ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "This was {disfmarker} Yeah . I didn't push him on the ch on the child thing ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "but , uh , you know , a again , if {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} if you"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "um , and this was {disfmarker} this was literacy , which actually is somewhat different problem ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Maybe easier . I don't know . So this is reading , rather than teaching {disfmarker} Another project we started on , and {disfmarker} and didn't get funded for was , uh , to try to build an automatic tutoring program , for kids whose first language wasn't English . Which is like half the school population in California . Something like that ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "isn't it ? Yeah . So , enormous problem in California , and the idea was if we 're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding , couldn't we build {vocalsound} uh , programs that would be tutors for the kids . We think we could . Anyway . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} But this is a slightly different problem ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "and um , I know none of us have the spare time to look at it right now , but it i it 's {disfmarker} it 's interesting and I may um , talk to him some more about is em somebody already doing this , and stuff like that . So anyway , that was {disfmarker} that was today 's little story ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "OK . So I {disfmarker} I did manage to get {disfmarker} pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into CITRIS ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "No , no ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "but uh or {disfmarker} a temporarily putting it out of the sling"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "but , I {disfmarker} I 'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that I am n uh among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "and also revising , thanks for all the comments , the c the original construal proposal .

Right . Anyway . Yeah , so {disfmarker} OK , so that 'd be great , but I 'd {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's time again , right ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Absolutely . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Yeah .

So if you know anyone interested in {disfmarker} in what i 'm about to describe , tell that person to {disfmarker} to write a mail to me or Jerry soon , fast .

Fine , that 's alright , that 's OK . And {disfmarker} and , {pause} you know , in contrast , so Deborah {disfmarker} d and also Deborah Tannen 's {pause} thesis she talked about differences of these types , {pause} that they 're just different styles , and it 's um {pause} you {disfmarker} you can't impose a model of {disfmarker} {pause} there {disfmarker} of the ideal being no overlaps , and {pause} you know , conversational analysts also agree with that , so it 's {pause} now , universally {pause} a ag agreed with . And {disfmarker} and , als I mean , I can't say universally , but anyway , the people who used to say it was strict , {pause} um {pause} now , uh {pause} don't . I mean they {disfmarker} they {pause} also {pause} {vocalsound} you know , uh {pause} uh , ack acknowledge the influence of {pause} sub of subcultural norms and {pause} cross - cultural norms and things . So , um Then it beco {pause} though {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} just superficially to give {pause} um {pause} a couple ideas of the types of overlaps involved , I have at the bottom several that I noticed . So , {pause} {vocalsound} uh , there are backchannels , like what Adam just did now and , um {pause} {vocalsound} um , anticipating the end of a question and {pause} simply answering it earlier , and there are several of those in this {disfmarker} in these data where {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc F", "content": "because we 're {pause} people who 've talked to each other , um {pause} we know {pause} basically what the topic is , what the possibilities are and w and we 've spoken with each other so we know basically what the other person 's style is likely to be and so {vocalsound} and t there are a number of places where someone just answered early . No problem .

Maybe {disfmarker} maybe we have a couple languages in the training set and that gives us enough breadth uh , uh , that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that the rest doesn't matter .

Yeah , so basically , uh , Chuck will be the one who will be sorting out what disk needs to be where , and so on , and I 'll be the one who says , \" OK , spend the money . \" So . {vocalsound} Which , I mean , n these days , uh , if you 're talking about scratch space , it doesn't increase the , uh , need for backup , and , uh , I think it 's not that big a d and the {disfmarker} the disks themselves are not that expensive . Right now it 's {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "What you can do , when you 're on that machine , is , uh , just go to the slash - scratch directory , and do a DF minus K , and it 'll tell you if there 's space available ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Uh , and if there is then , uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "But wasn't it , uh {disfmarker} I think Dave was saying that he preferred that people didn't put stuff in slash - scratch .

So there 's the slash - X - whatever disks , and then there 's slash - scratch . And both of those two kinds are not backed up . And if it 's called \" slash - scratch \" , it means it 's probably an internal disk to the machine . Um . And so that 's the kind of thing where , like if {disfmarker} um , OK , if you don't have an NT , but you have a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a Unix workstation , and they attach an external disk , {comment} it 'll be called \" slash - X - something \" uh , if it 's not backed up and it 'll be \" slash - D - something \" if it is backed up . And if it 's inside the machine on the desk , it 's called \" slash - scratch \" . But the problem is , if you ever get a new machine , they take your machine away . It 's easy to unhook the external disks , put them back on the new machine , but then your slash - scratch is gone . So , you don't wanna put anything in slash - scratch that you wanna keep around for a long period of time . But if it 's a copy of , say , some data that 's on a server , you can put it on slash - scratch because , um , first of all it 's not backed up , and second it doesn't matter if that machine disappears and you get a new machine because you just recopy it to slash - scratch . So tha that 's why I was saying you could check slash - scratch on those {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on , um , Mustard and {disfmarker} and Nutmeg to see if {disfmarker} if there 's space that you could use there ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "I see ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "You could also use slash - X - whatever disks on Mustard and Nutmeg ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Yeah , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Um .

OK . Uh . Alright . And uh {disfmarker} and the other {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the last topic I had here was , um , uh d Dave 's fine offer to {disfmarker} to , uh , do something {pause} {vocalsound} on this .

But I think the first responsibility is sort of to figure out if there 's something {pause} that , uh , an {disfmarker} an additional {disfmarker} Uh , that 's a good thing you {disfmarker} remove the mike . Go ahead , good . Uh , uh . What an additional clever person could help with when we 're really in a crunch for time . Right ?

If we can think of something {disfmarker} some piece of this that 's going to be {disfmarker} The very fact that it is sort of just work , and i and it 's running programs and so forth , is exactly why {pause} it 's possible that it {disfmarker} some piece of could be handed to someone to do , because it 's not {disfmarker} Uh , yeah , so that {disfmarker} that 's the question . And we don't have to solve it right this s second , but if we could think of some {disfmarker} some piece that 's {disfmarker} that 's well defined , that he could help with , he 's expressing a will willingness to do that ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "What about training up a , um , a multilingual net ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Uh ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yes , maybe to , mmm , put together the {disfmarker} the label {disfmarker} the labels between TIMIT and Spanish or something like that ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Yeah .

Yeah , that 's something that needs to be done in any event ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "So what we were just saying is that {disfmarker} that , um {disfmarker} I was arguing for , {pause} if possible , coming up with something that {disfmarker} that really was development and wasn't research because we {disfmarker} we 're {disfmarker} we have a time crunch . And so , uh , if there 's something that would {disfmarker} would save some time that someone else could do on some other piece , then we should think of that first . See the thing with voiced - unvoiced - silence is I really think that {disfmarker} that it 's {disfmarker} to do {disfmarker} to do a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a poor job is {disfmarker} is pretty quick , uh , or , you know , a so - so job . You can {disfmarker} you can {disfmarker} you can throw in a couple fea we know what {disfmarker} what kinds of features help with it ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "You can throw something in . You can do pretty well . But I remember , in fact , when you were working on that , and you worked on for few months , as I recall , and you got to , say ninety - three percent , and getting to ninety - four {pause} {vocalsound} really really hard ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Mm - hmm . Another year ."}, {"speaker": "Professor F", "content": "Yeah , yeah . So , um {disfmarker} And th th the other tricky thing is , since we are , uh , even though we 're not {disfmarker} we don't have a strict prohibition on memory size , and {disfmarker} and computational complexity , uh , clearly there 's some limitation to it . So if we have to {disfmarker} if we say we have to have a pitch detector , say , if we {disfmarker} if we 're trying to incorporate pitch information , or at least some kind of harmonic {disfmarker} harmonicity , or something , this is another whole thing , take a while to develop . Anyway , it 's a very very interesting topic . I mean , one {disfmarker} I think one of the {disfmarker} a lot of people would say , and I think Dan would also , uh , that one of the things wrong with current speech recognition is that we {disfmarker} we really do throw away all the harmonicity information . Uh , we try to get spectral envelopes . Reason for doing that is that most of the information about the phonetic identity is in the spectral envelopes are not in the harmonic detail . But the harmonic detail does tell you something . Like the fact that there is harmonic detail is {disfmarker} is real important . So . Um . So , uh . So I think {disfmarker} Yeah . So {disfmarker} wh that {disfmarker} so the {disfmarker} the other suggestion that just came up was , well what about having him {pause} work on the , uh , {pause} multilingual super f superset {pause} kind of thing . Uh , coming up with that and then , you know , training it {disfmarker} training a net on that , say , um , from {disfmarker} from , uh {disfmarker} from TIMIT or something .

And analogously for example , here we have our EVA um {disfmarker} intention . And these are the data tasks where w we can assume the person would like to enter , view or just approach the thing . Analogously the same on the object information we can see that , you know , we have sort of created these tasks before we came up with our decision nodes so there 's a lot of things where we have no analogous tasks , and {pause} that may or may not be a problem . We can change the tasks slightly if we feel that we should have data for e sort of for every decision node so {disfmarker} trying to im um {disfmarker} implant the intention of going to a place now , going to a place later on the same tour , or trying to plant the intention of going sometime on the next tour , or the next day or whenever ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Right , right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "But I think that might be overdoing it a little ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "So {disfmarker} Yeah . So let me pop up a level . And uh s s make sure that we 're all oriented the same . So What we 're gonna do today is two related things . Uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief - net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi the system uh making decisions . And decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices for calls on other modules . so f the natural language understanding thing is uh , we think gonna only have to choose parameters , but You know , a fairly large set of parameters . So to do that , we need to do two things . One of which is figure out what all the choices are , which we 've done a fair amount . Then we need to figure out what influences its choices and finally we have to do some technical work on the actual belief relations and presumably estimates of the probabilities and stuff . But we aren't gonna do the probability stuff today . Technical stuff we 'll do {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} another day . Probably next week . But we are gonna worry about all the decisions and the things that pert that contribute to them . And we 're also , sort of uh in the same process , going to work with Fey on what there should be in the dialogues . So One of the s steps that 's coming up real soon is to actually get subjects uh {disfmarker} in here , and have them actually record like this . Uh record dialogues more or less .

So the uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} on the left are decision nodes , and discreet values .

And at that point I discovered certain things like , um , \" accommodate \" with one \" M \" , that kind of thing .

Exactly ! Exactly !

And th and then another check involves , uh , being sure that every utterance has an identifiable speaker . And if not , then that gets checked . Then there 's this issue of glossing s w so - called \" spoken - forms \" . So there {disfmarker} mo for the most part , we 're keeping it standard wo word level transcription . But there 's {disfmarker} w And that that 's done with the assumption that {pause} pronunciation variants can be handled . So for things like \" and \" , the fact that someone doesn't say the \" D \" , uh that 's not important enough to capture in the transcription because a {disfmarker} a good pronunciation , uh , you know , model would be able to handle that .

So \" wanna \" is another one , \" going {disfmarker} \" uh , \" gonna \" is another one , with just the assumption , again , that this {disfmarker} th these are things which it 's not really fair to a c consider {disfmarker} expect that {disfmarker} a pronunciation model , to handle .

OK . Ah , interesting . Yeah . Yeah . Oh , sure . Yeah , sure .

Ah ! Clever . Yes . Clever . Yeah . Excellent ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah , in fact after our meeting uh , this morning Thilo came in and said that {vocalsound} um , there could be {pause} other differences between {vocalsound} the uh {pause} already transcribed meeting with the beeps in it and one that has {pause} just r been run through his process ."}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "And that 's the purpose .

I discussed this with you too . Um , the tr so the idea initially was , we would get {vocalsound} uh , for the new meetings , so the e EDU meetings , that {vocalsound} Thilo ha has now presegmented all of them for us , on a channel by channel basis . And um , so , I 've assigned {disfmarker} I 've {disfmarker} I 've assigned them to our transcribers and um , so far I 've discussed it with one , with uh {disfmarker} And I had a {pause} about an hour discussion with her about this yesterday , we went through {vocalsound} uh EDU - one , at some extent . And it occurred to me that {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} that {vocalsound} basically what we have in this kind of a format is {disfmarker} you could consider it as a staggered mixed file , we had some discussion over the weekend a about {disfmarker} at {disfmarker} at this other meeting that we were all a at {disfmarker} um , {vocalsound} about whether the tran the IBM transcribers should hear a single channel audio , or a mixed channel audio . And um , {vocalsound} in {disfmarker} in a way , by {disfmarker} by having this {disfmarker} this chunk and then the backchannel {vocalsound} after it , it 's like a stagal staggered mixed channel . And um , {vocalsound} it occurred {pause} to me in my discussion with her yesterday that um , um , the {disfmarker} {pause} the {disfmarker} the maximal gain , it 's {disfmarker} from the IBM {pause} people , may be in long stretches of connected speech . So it 's basically a whole bunch of words {vocalsound} which they can really do , because of the continuity within that person 's turn . So , what I 'm thinking , and it may be that not all meetings will be good for this , {comment} but {disfmarker} but what I 'm thinking is that {vocalsound} in the EDU meetings , they tend to be {vocalsound} driven by a couple of dominant speakers . And , if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers , {vocalsound} then , when {disfmarker} when it got s patched together when it comes back from IBM , we can add the backchannels . It seems to me {vocalsound} that {vocalsound} um , you know , the backchannels per - se wouldn't be so hard , but then there 's this question of the time {pause} @ @ {comment} uh , marking , and whether the beeps would be {vocalsound} uh y y y And I 'm not exactly sure how that {disfmarker} how that would work with the {disfmarker} with the backchannels . And , so um {disfmarker} And certainly things that are {vocalsound} intrusions of multiple words , {vocalsound} taken out of context and displaced in time from where they occurred , {vocalsound} that would be hard . So , m my {vocalsound} thought is {pause} i I 'm having this transcriber go through {vocalsound} the EDU - one meeting , and indicate a start time {nonvocalsound} f for each dominant speaker , endpoi end time for each dominant speaker , and the idea that {vocalsound} these units would be generated for the dominant speakers , {vocalsound} and maybe not for the other channels ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Yeah the only , um , disadvantage of that is , then it 's hard to use an automatic method to do that .

I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} I think um , you know , the original plan was that the transcriber would adjust the t the boundaries , and all that for all the channels but , {vocalsound} you know , that is so time - consuming , and since we have a bottleneck here , we want to get IBM things that are usable s as soon as possible , then this seemed to me it 'd be a way of gett to get them a flood of data , which would be useful when it comes back to us .

I 'll just , you know , recode them . But um , {vocalsound} um , the transcribable events {pause} that um , I 'm considering in this , {vocalsound} uh , continue to be {vocalsound} laugh , as well as speech , and cough and things like that , so I 'm not stripping out anything , just {disfmarker} just you know , being very lenient in what 's considered speech .

In those I trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . And , um , here , I was curious , what if I trained the models using twelve seconds but I f I gave it a situation where the test set I was {disfmarker} subtracted using two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . And , um {disfmarker} So I did that for about three different conditions . And , um {disfmarker} I mean , I th I think it was , um , four se I think {disfmarker} I think it was , um , something like four seconds and , um , six seconds , and eight seconds . Something like that . And it seems like it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it hurts compared to if you actually train the models {comment} using th that same length of time but it {disfmarker} it doesn't hurt that much . Um , u usually less than point five percent , although I think I did see one where it was a point eight percent or so rise in word error rate . But this is , um , w where , um , even if I train on the , uh , model , and mean subtracted it with the same length of time as in the test , it {disfmarker} the word error rate is around , um , ten percent or nine percent .

Um ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "S so , um , the {disfmarker} the idea of the second pass would be waiting till you have more recorded speech ? Or {disfmarker} ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Yeah , so if it turned out to be a problem , that you didn't have enough speech because you need a longer {disfmarker} longer window to do this processing , then , uh , one tactic is {disfmarker} you know , looking at the larger system and not just at the front - end stuff {comment} {disfmarker} is to take in , um , the speech with some simpler mechanism or shorter time mechanism ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "um , do the best you can , and come up with some al possible alternates of what might have been said .

OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "um , and again , if the second pass is really , really fast {disfmarker} Uh , another one I 've heard of is {disfmarker} is in {disfmarker} in connected digit stuff , um , going back and l and through backtrace and finding regions that are considered to be a d a digit , but , uh , which have very low energy ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Mm - hmm .

Uh , so yeah , the next thing I started to do is to , {vocalsound} uh , try to develop a better voice activity detector .

Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "The other thing is , at the other end , roughly at the same level , there 's something that takes , uh , X M L structures , produces an output XML structure which is instructions for the generator ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK ? And then there 's a language generator , and then after that a s a synthesizer that goes from an XML structure to , uh , language generation , to actual specifications for a synthesizer . Eh , but again , there 's one module in which there 's one piece {vocalsound} that we have to convert to English ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Right . Right . Got it ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Is that {disfmarker} OK . And that {disfmarker} But as I say , this is {disfmarker} all along was viewed as a kind of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a m a minor thing , necessary , but {disfmarker} but not {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "And much more interesting is the fact that , {vocalsound} as part of doing this , we {disfmarker} we are , you know , inheriting this system that does all sort of these other {vocalsound} things ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "That 's great !

I 've got a couple new Wu papers as well .

So , I mean , we 'd like to {disfmarker} take all these various cues , right ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Like the army ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "So this one might be , say , uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "New terminology ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Hmm ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Well , let me pick a random one"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "I haven't heard that before ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "and say , uh {disfmarker} I don't know , it could be , like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} This isn't the way it really is , but let me say {disfmarker} that , suppose someone mentioned , uh , admission fees Ah , it takes too long . Try {disfmarker} let me just say \" Landmark \" . If the thing is a landmark , you know , {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} then there 's another thing that says if {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} if it 's closed or not , at the moment . Alright , so you have nodes . Right ? And the , uh , problem that we were having was that , you know , given N - nodes , there 's \" two to the N \" Given N - nodes , and furthermore , the fact that there 's three things here , we need to specify \" three times \" , uh , \" two to the N \" probabilities . Right ? That 's assuming these are all binary , which f they may not be . For example , they could be \" time of day \" , in which case we could , uh , say , you know , \" Morning , afternoon , evening , night \" . So , this could be more So , it 's a lot , anyway . And , that 's a lot of probabilities to put here , which is kind of a pain . So {pause} Noisy - ORs are a way to , uh , {vocalsound} sort of deal with this . Um Where should I put this ? So , the idea is that , um , {vocalsound} Let 's call these , uh , C - one , C - two , C - three , and C - four , and E , for Cause and Effect , I guess . The idea is to have these intermediate nodes . Right . Well , actually , the idea , first of all , is that each of these things has a {disfmarker} quote - unquote distinguished state , which means that this is {vocalsound} the state in which we don't really know anything about it . So {disfmarker} right ? So , for example , if we don't really know {vocalsound} if the thing is a landmark or not , Or , i if that just doesn't seem relevant , then that would be th sort of the Disting - the Distinguish state . It 's a really , you know , {vocalsound} if there is something for the person talking about the admission fee , you know , if they didn't talk about it , that would be the Distinguish state ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "S so , this is a fanciful way of saying \" default \" ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "So {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "That 's just what they {disfmarker} the word they used in that paper ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "So , the idea is that , um , {vocalsound} you have these intermediate nodes , right ? E - one , E - two , E - three and E - four ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So , this is the Heckerman paper you 're working with ? Good ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . So {pause} The idea is that , each of these EI {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} represents what this would be {disfmarker} if all the other ones were in the distinguish state . Right ? So , for example , suppose that the person {disfmarker} I mean , suppose the thing that they talked about is a landmark . But none of the other {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sort of cues really apply . Then , {vocalsound} this would be {disfmarker} W The {vocalsound} this would just represent the probability distribution of this , assuming that this cue is turned on and the other ones just didn't apply ? So , you know , if it is a landmark , and no none of the other things really ap applicable , then {disfmarker} this would represent the probability distribution . So maybe in this case {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Maybe we just t k Maybe we decide that , if the thing 's a landmark and we don't know anything else , then we 're gonna conclude that , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} They want to view it with probability , you know , point four . They want to enter it with probability , uh {disfmarker} with probability point five and they want to approach it probability point one , say {disfmarker} Right ? So we come up with these l little tables for each of those OK . And the final thing is that , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} this is a deterministic function of these , so we don't need to specify any probabilities . We just have to , um , say what function this is , right ? So we can let this be , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} G of E - one comma E - two . E - three , E - four . Right ? and our example G would be , um , {vocalsound} a majority vote ? Right ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Well . OK , so th so the important point {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} W not what the G function is . The important point is {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} There is a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a general kind of idea of shortcutting the full CPT . Th - c the full conditional probability table {disfmarker} with some function . OK ? Which y w you choose appropriately for each case . So , depending on {vocalsound} what your situation is , there are different functions which are most appropriate .

So the little handout that {disfmarker} The little thing that I sent {disfmarker} I sent a message saying , uh , here is a way to take {disfmarker} One thing you could do , which is kind of s in a way , stupid , is take this deterministic function , and use it to build the CPT .

So you just take {vocalsound} the {disfmarker} uh , if each of th if each of the ones has its own little table like that , {vocalsound} then you could take the , uh , strength of each of those , times its little table , and you 'd add up the total evidence for \" V \" , \" E \" , and \" A \" ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mmm .

And , um , I 'm going to be doing a more thorough editing , with respect to consistency of the conventions . But they 're {disfmarker} they 're generally very good . And , then , I run it through , uh , the channelize program to get it into the multi - channel format , OK . And {pause} the , what we discussed this morning , I would summarize as saying that , um , these units that result , in a {disfmarker} a particular channel and a particular timeband , at {disfmarker} at that level , um , vary in length . And , um , {nonvocalsound} their recognizer would prefer that the units not be overly long . But it 's really an empirical question , whether the units we get at this point through , just that process I described might be sufficient for them . So , as a first pass through , a first chance without having to do a lot of hand - editing , what we 're gonna do , is , I 'll run it through channelize , give them those data after I 've done the editing process and be sure it 's clean .

One {disfmarker} one being to just work with the complex numbers , um , and , uh {disfmarker} in rectangular kind of coordinates . And the other is {vocalsound} to , uh , do a Taylor series {disfmarker} Well .

And {disfmarker} and so if {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you have a {disfmarker} a number that is modulus , you know , uh , very different from one {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It should be right around one , if it 's {disfmarker} cuz it 's a expansion of log one {disfmarker} one minus epsilon or o is {disfmarker} is {vocalsound} one plus epsilon , or is it one plus {disfmarker} ?

I think everybody was focused elsewhere . Um , now , one of the things that 's nice about what we did is , we do have a {disfmarker} a , uh {disfmarker} a filtering , which leads to a {disfmarker} a , uh {disfmarker} a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum , which allows us to downsample .

Or Hmm ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Uh , well that 's {pause} um yeah I mean , I think the question is \" Is there {disfmarker} is there some advantage ? \" I mean , you could just take the best system and say that 's the standard . But the thing is that if different systems are getting at good things , um , a again within the constraint of the resources , if there 's something simple that you can do Now for instance , uh , it 's , I think , very reasonable to have a standard for the terminal 's side and then for the server 's side say , \" Here 's a number of things that could be done . \" So , um , everything that we did could probably just be added on to what Alcatel did , and i it 'd probably work pretty well with them , too . So , um , uh , that 's one {disfmarker} one aspect of it .

And , um , then it would {disfmarker} it would , uh {pause} be something to {disfmarker} to discuss in the meeting . But , uh , not clear what will go on . Um , I mean , on the one hand , um , sometimes people are just anxious to get a standard out there . I mean , you can always have another standard after that , but {vocalsound} this process has gone on for a while on {disfmarker} already and {disfmarker} and people might just wanna pick something and say , \" OK , this is it . \" And then , that 's a standard . Uh , standards are always optional . It 's just that , uh , if you disobey them , then you risk not being able to sell your product , or {pause} {vocalsound} Uh {pause} um And people often work on new standards while an old standard is in place and so on .

So I 've been working on integrating this mean subtraction approach into the SmartKom system . And there 's this question of , well , so , um , in my tests before with HTK I found it worked {disfmarker} it worked the best with about twelve seconds of data used to estimate the mean , but , we 'll often have less {comment} in the SmartKom system . Um . So I think we 'll use as much data as we have {pause} at a particular time , and we 'll {disfmarker} {vocalsound} we 'll concatenate utterances together , um , to get as much data as we possibly can from the user . But , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} there 's a question of how to set up the models . So um , we could train the models . If we think twelve seconds is ideal we could train the models using twelve seconds to calculate the mean , to mean subtract the training data . Or we could , um , use some other amount . So {disfmarker} like I did an experiment where I , um , was using six seconds in test , um , but , for {disfmarker} I tried twelve seconds in train . And I tried , um , um , the same in train {disfmarker} I 'm a I tried six seconds in train . And six seconds in train {vocalsound} was about point three percent better . Um , and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um , it 's not clear to me yet whether that 's {vocalsound} something significant .

So , um , with the {disfmarker} with the HTK set - up I should be able to do some experiments , on just varying that length , say between one and three seconds , in a few different reverberation conditions , um , say this room and also a few of the artificial impulse responses we have for reverberation , just , um , making some plots and seeing how they look . And , um , so , with the {disfmarker} the sampling rate I was using , one second or two seconds or four seconds is at a power of two um , number of samples and , um , I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll jus f for the ones in between I guess I 'll just zero - pad ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Mm - hmm .

And , uh , the third one is how do we {disfmarker} how do we merge all the , uh , information from the individual uh , multi - band classifiers to come up with word {disfmarker} word recognition or {disfmarker} or phone recognition things .

Maybe we 'll just start with you ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "Yeah . But I actually stuck most of this in our m last meeting with Guenter . Um , but I 'll just {disfmarker} Um , so the last week , uh , I showed some results with only SpeechDat - Car which was like some fifty - six percent . And , uh , I didn't h I mean , I {disfmarker} I found that the results {disfmarker} I mean , I wasn't getting that r results on the TI - digit . So I was like looking into \" why , what is wrong with the TI - digits ? \" . Why {disfmarker} why I was not getting it . And I found that , the noise estimation is a reason for the TI - digits to perform worse than the baseline . So , uh , I actually , picked th I mean , the first thing I did was I just scaled the noise estimate by a factor which is less than one to see if that {disfmarker} because I found there are a lot of zeros in the spectrogram for the TI - digits when I used this approach . So the first thing I did was I just scaled the noise estimate . And I found {disfmarker} So the {disfmarker} the results that I 've shown here are the complete results using the new {disfmarker} Well , the n the new technique is nothing but the noise estimate scaled by a factor of point five . So it 's just an ad - hoc {disfmarker} I mean , some intermediate result , because it 's not optimized for anything . So the results {disfmarker} The trend {disfmarker} the only trend I could see from those results was like the {disfmarker} the p the current noise estimation or the , uh , noise composition scheme is working good for like the car noise type of thing . Because I 've {disfmarker} the only {disfmarker} only {disfmarker} p very good result in the TI - digits is the noise {disfmarker} car noise condition for their test - A , which is like the best I could see that uh , for any non - stationary noise like \" Babble \" or \" Subway \" or any {disfmarker} \" Street \" , some \" Restaurant \" noise , it 's like {disfmarker} it 's not performing w very well .

Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "And .

Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Um . So . I mean , the HTK is an older HTK , even . So . Yeah it {disfmarker} it 's not that surprising ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "But to me it just {disfmarker} it just meant a practical {vocalsound} point that um if we want to {vocalsound} publish results on digits that {disfmarker} that people pay {vocalsound} attention to we probably should uh {disfmarker} Cuz we 've had the problem before that you get {disfmarker} show some {vocalsound} nice improvement on something that 's {disfmarker} that 's uh , uh {disfmarker} it seems like too large a number , and uh {vocalsound} uh people don't necessarily take it so seriously ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Um .

Yeah , but they had to {pause} get rid of it because of the space , didn't they ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah . So . Yeah .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Yeah but {disfmarker} nnn ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "But the other thing is uh to use a different VAD entirely .

You miss most of the reverberation tail in a ten millisecond window and so {vocalsound} {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} you 'd like it to be that {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} the reverberation responses um simply convolved um in , but it 's not really with these ten millisecond frames cuz you j But if you take , say , a two millisecond {vocalsound} um window {disfmarker} I 'm sorry a two second window then in a room like this , most of the reverberation response {vocalsound} is included in the window and the {disfmarker} then it um {vocalsound} then things are l more linear . It is {disfmarker} it is more like the reverberation response is simply c convolved and um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and you can use channel normalization techniques {vocalsound} like uh in his thesis he 's assuming that the reverberation response is fixed . He just does um {vocalsound} mean subtraction , which is like removing the DC component of the modulation spectrum and {vocalsound} that 's supposed to d um deal {disfmarker} uh deal pretty well with the um reverberation and um {vocalsound} the neat thing is you can't take these two second frames and feed them to a speech recognizer um {vocalsound} so he does this {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} method training trading the um {vocalsound} the spectral resolution for time resolution {vocalsound} and um {vocalsound} come ca uh synthesizes a new representation which is with say ten second frames but a lower s um {vocalsound} frequency resolution .

But for the real situation uh , problem is , is that you don't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise . And if you don't include that in the model , it doesn't work very well . So in fact it might be a very nice thing to do , to just take the noise removal part of it and put that in front of what he 's looking at .

And that 's I mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and {disfmarker} and , uh {disfmarker} and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and {disfmarker} and additive effects . And that 's hard enough . I mean , I don't think we really {disfmarker} I mean , we 're trying to deal with that . In a sense that 's what we 're trying to deal with in this Aurora task . And we have , uh , the , uh , uh , LDA stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects . And we have the noise suppression that 's doing something about noise . Uh , even that 's hard enough . And {disfmarker} and the on - line normalization as well , in that s category . i i There 's all these interactions between these two and that 's part of why these guys had to work so hard on {disfmarker} on juggling everything around . But now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse , because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects . And , um , so Dave has something which , uh , is doing some nice things under some conditions with {disfmarker} with long time effects but when it 's {disfmarker} when there 's noise there too , it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's pretty hard . So we have to start {disfmarker} Since any {disfmarker} almost any real situation is gonna have {disfmarker} uh , where you have the microphone distant , is going to have both things , we {disfmarker} we actually have to think about both at the same time ."}, {"speaker": "PhD E", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So , um {disfmarker} So there 's this noise suppression thing , which is sort of worked out and then , uh , maybe you should just continue telling what {disfmarker} what else is in the {disfmarker} the form we have ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah , well , {vocalsound} the , um , the other parts of the system are the {disfmarker} the blocks that were already present before and that we did not modify a lot ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So that 's {disfmarker} again , that {disfmarker} that 's the Wiener filtering , followed by , uh {disfmarker} uh , that 's done at the FFT level .

There 's questions about {pause} various places where there 's an exponent , if it 's the right exponent , or {pause} ways that we 're estimating noise , that we can improve estimating noise .

Yeah . And , um So ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "So in that case , the sum we 'd have {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} I mean , these wouldn't be the summary nodes .

But the other part of it is the way they connect to these , uh , probabilistic relational models . So {pause} there 's all the problems that the linguists know about , about mental spaces , and the cognitive linguists know about , but then there 's this problem of the belief - net people have only done a moderately good job of dealing with temporal belief - nets . Uh , which they call dynamic {disfmarker} they incorrectly call dynamic belief - nets ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "So there 's a term \" dynamic belief - net \" , doesn't mean that . It means time slices . And Srini used those and people use them . Uh . But one of the things I w would like to do over the next , uh , month , it may take more , {comment} is to st understand to what extent we can not only figure out the constructions for them for multiple worlds and uh sort of what the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be , but also what that would translate into in terms of belief - net and the inferences . So the story is that if you have these probabilistic relational models , they 're set up , in principle , so that you can make new instances and instances connect to each other , and all that sort of stuff , so it should be feasible to set them up in such a way that if you 've got the past tense and the present tense and each of those is a separate {pause} uh , belief structure that they do their inferences with just the couplings that are appropriate . But that 's g that 's , as far as I can tell , it 's {disfmarker} it 's putting together two real hard problems . One is the linguistic part of what are the couplings and {disfmarker} and when you have a certain , uh , construction , that implies certain couplings and other couplings , you know , between let 's say between the past and the present , or any other one of these things and then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the belief - net work if it 's got um , let 's say one in {disfmarker} in , you know , different tenses or my beliefs and your beliefs , or any of these other ones of {disfmarker} of multiple models . So um you know , in the long run we need to solve both of those and my suggestion is that we start digging into them both , uh , in a way we that , you know , th hopefully turns out to be consistent , so that the {disfmarker} Um .

The ontology will tell us that castles have opening hours , that they have admission fees , they have whatever . And then , this is {disfmarker} We go via a thesaurus and look up {pause} certain linguistic surface structures {pause} that are related to these concepts and feed those through the dialogue history and check dynamically for each e entity .

So , some of these smoothing issues are over - fitting for that matter ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD I", "content": "And the Baum - Welch should be much less of a factor , if you go full {disfmarker} whole hog ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Could be . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD I", "content": "And so , w so , just um {disfmarker} so the strategy is to first sort of treat things {pause} with fast turn - around on a smaller training set and then , {vocalsound} when you 've sort of , narrowed it down , you try it on a larger training set ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD I", "content": "And so , we haven't done that yet ."}, {"speaker": "Professor D", "content": "Now the other que related question , though , is {disfmarker} is , {vocalsound} uh , what 's the boot models for these things ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD I", "content": "Th - th the boot models are trained from scratch . So we compute , um {disfmarker} So , we start with a , um , alil alignment that we computed with the b sort of the best system we have . And {disfmarker} and then we train from scratch . So we com we do a , you know , w um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We collect the {disfmarker} uh , the observations from those alignments under each of the feature sets that {disfmarker} that we {pause} train . And then , from there we do , um {disfmarker} There 's a lot of , actually {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The way it works , you first train a phonetically - tied mixture model . Um . You do a total of {disfmarker} First you do a context - independent PTM model . Then you switch to a context {disfmarker} You do two iterations of that . Then you do two iterations of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of context - dependent phonetically - tied mixtures .

Suppose y you can't adjust {vocalsound} these word insertion penalties and so forth , so you have to do everything at the level of the features . What could you do ?

But , uh , uh , {comment} uh , n not {disfmarker} not so much in this meeting about Aurora , but {disfmarker} but , uh , uh , maybe just , uh , quickly today about {disfmarker} maybe you could just say a little bit about what you 've been talking about with Michael . And {disfmarker} and then Barry can say something about {pause} what {comment} {disfmarker} what we 're talking about ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK . So Michael Kleinschmidt , who 's a PHD student from Germany , {vocalsound} showed up this week . He 'll be here for about six months . And he 's done some work using {vocalsound} an auditory model {pause} of , um , {vocalsound} human hearing , and {pause} using that f uh , to generate speech recognition features . And {pause} he did {vocalsound} work back in Germany {vocalsound} with , um , a toy recognition system {vocalsound} using , um , isolated {vocalsound} digit recognition {vocalsound} as the task . It was actually just a single - layer neural network {vocalsound} that classified words {disfmarker} classified digits , {vocalsound} in fact . Um , and {pause} he tried that on {disfmarker} I think on some Aurora data and got results that he thought {pause} seemed respectable . And he w he 's coming here to u u use it on a {vocalsound} uh , a real speech recognition system . So I 'll be working with him on that . And , um , maybe I should say a little more about these features , although I don't understand them that well . The {disfmarker} I think it 's a two - stage idea . And , um , {vocalsound} the first stage of these features correspond to what 's called the peripheral {vocalsound} auditory system . And {vocalsound} I guess that is like {vocalsound} a filter bank with a compressive nonlinearity . And {vocalsound} I 'm - I 'm not sure what we have @ @ in there that isn't already modeled in something like , {vocalsound} um , {pause} PLP . I should learn more about that . And then {vocalsound} the second stage {pause} is , um , {vocalsound} the most different thing , I think , from what we usually do . It 's , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} it computes features which are , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} based on {disfmarker} sort of like based on diffe different w um , wavelet basis functions {vocalsound} used to analyze {vocalsound} the input .  So th he uses analysis functions called {vocalsound} Gabor functions , um , {vocalsound} which have a certain {vocalsound} extent , um , {vocalsound} in time and in frequency . And {vocalsound} the idea is these are used to sample , {vocalsound} um , the signal in a represented as a time - frequency representation . So you 're {pause} sampling some piece of this time - frequency plane . And , um , {vocalsound} that , {vocalsound} um , is {disfmarker} is interesting , cuz , {vocalsound} @ @ for {disfmarker} for one thing , you could use it , {vocalsound} um , in a {disfmarker} a multi - scale way . You could have these {disfmarker} instead of having everything {disfmarker} like we use a twenty - five millisecond or so analysis window , {vocalsound} typically , um , and that 's our time scale for features , but you could {disfmarker} {vocalsound} using this , um , basis function idea , you could have some basis functions which have a lot longer time scale and , um , some which have a lot shorter , and {vocalsound} so it would be like {pause} a set of multi - scale features . So he 's interested in , um {disfmarker} Th - this is {disfmarker} because it 's , um {disfmarker} there are these different parameters for the shape of these {vocalsound} basis functions , {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} there are a lot of different possible basis functions . And so he {disfmarker} {vocalsound} he actually does {vocalsound} an optimization procedure to choose an {disfmarker} {vocalsound} an optimal set of basis functions out of all the possible ones ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Hmm .

I mean , {vocalsound} i i {nonvocalsound} in truth , {pause} both pieces of this are {disfmarker} have their analogies in stuff we already do . But it 's a different take {vocalsound} at how to approach it and potentially one that 's m maybe a bit more systematic than what we 've done , uh , and a b a bit more inspiration from {disfmarker} from auditory things . So it 's {disfmarker} so I think it 's a neat thing to try . The primary features , {vocalsound} um , are in fact {disfmarker} Yeah , essentially , it 's {disfmarker} it 's , uh , you know , PLP or {disfmarker} or mel cepstrum , or something like that . You 've {disfmarker} you 've got some , {vocalsound} uh , compression . We always have some compression . We always have some {disfmarker} you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the kind of filter bank with a kind of {vocalsound} {vocalsound} quasi - log scaling . Um , {vocalsound} if you put in {disfmarker} if you also include the RASTA in it {disfmarker} i RASTA {disfmarker} the filtering being done in the log domain {vocalsound} has an AGC - like , uh , characteristic , which , you know , people typi typically put in these kind of , {vocalsound} uh , {pause} um , {vocalsound} uh , auditory front - ends . So it 's very , very similar , uh , but it 's not exactly the same . Um , I would agree that the second one is {disfmarker} is somewhat more different but , {vocalsound} um , it 's mainly different in that the things that we have been doing like that have been {disfmarker} {vocalsound} um , had a different kind of motivation and have ended up with different kinds of constraints . So , for instance , if you look at the LDA RASTA stuff , {vocalsound} you know , basically what they do is they {disfmarker} they look at the different eigenvectors out of the LDA and they form filters out of it . Right ? And those {pause} filters have different , uh , kinds of temporal extents and temporal characteristics . And so in fact they 're multi - scale . But , they 're not sort of systematically multi - scale , like \" let 's start here and go to there , and go to there , and go to there \" , and so forth . It 's more like , {vocalsound} you run it on this , you do discriminant analysis , and you find out what 's helpful . "}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "I it 's multi - scale because you use several of these in parallel ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah . They use several of them ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "is that right ? Of {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh , I mean , you don't have to but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but , uh , Hynek has . Um , but it 's also , uh {disfmarker}  Hyn - when Hynek 's had people do this kind of LDA analysis , they 've done it on frequency direction and they 've done it on the time direction . I think he may have had people sometimes doing it on both simultaneously {disfmarker} some two - D {disfmarker} and that would be the closest to these Gabor function kind of things . Uh , but I don't think they 've done that much of that . And , uh , the other thing that 's interesting {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the , uh {disfmarker} the feature selection thing , it 's a simple method , but I kinda like it . Um , {vocalsound} there 's a {disfmarker} {pause} a old , old method for feature selection . I mean , {pause} eh , uh , I remember people referring to it as old when I was playing with it twenty years ago , so I know it 's pretty old , uh , called Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis in which you {disfmarker} which {disfmarker} I think it 's used in social sciences a lot . So , you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you pick the best feature . And then {vocalsound} you take {disfmarker} y you find the next feature that 's the best in combination with it . And then so on and so on . And what {disfmarker} what Michael 's describing seems to me much , much better , because the problem with the stepwise discriminant analysis is that you don't know that {disfmarker} you know , if you 've {vocalsound} picked the right set of features . Just because something 's a good feature doesn't mean that you should be adding it . So , {vocalsound} um , {pause} uh , here at least you 're starting off with all of them , and you 're {vocalsound} throwing out useless features . I think that 's {disfmarker} that seems , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that seems like a lot better idea . Uh , you 're always looking at things in combination with other features . Um , so the only thing is , of course , there 's this {disfmarker} this artificial question of {disfmarker} of , uh , {vocalsound} exactly how you {disfmarker} how you a how you assess it and if {disfmarker} if your order had been different in throwing them out . I mean , it still isn't necessarily really optimal , but it seems like a pretty good heuristic . So I th I think it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} I think it 's kinda neat stuff ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "And {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , uh , the thing that I wanted to {disfmarker} to add to it also was to have us use this in a multi - stream way ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Um , so {disfmarker} so that , um , {vocalsound} when you come up with these different things , {vocalsound} and these different functions , {vocalsound} you don't necessarily just put them all into one huge vector , but perhaps {vocalsound} you {vocalsound} have some of them in one stream and some of them in another stream , and so forth . And , um , um , {comment} um {disfmarker} And we 've also talked a little bit about , uh , {vocalsound} uh , Shihab Shamma 's stuff , in which {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} the way you look at it is that there 's these different mappings and some of them emphasize , uh , upward moving , {vocalsound} uh , energy and fre and frequency .

And so have you put all these numbers together into a single number representing that ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "I mean not {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Uh not yet ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "No . Mmm yeah , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "then we could compare the two and say what was better ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Mmm . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Um and how does this compare to the numbers {disfmarker} oh so OGI two is just the top {disfmarker} top row ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "So yeah to {disfmarker} actually OGI two is the {disfmarker} the baseline with the OGI features but this is not exactly the result that they have because they 've {disfmarker} they 're still made some changes in the features"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "and {disfmarker} well but uh actually our results are better than their results . Um I don't know by how much because they did not send us the new results"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Uh"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh OK so the one {disfmarker} one place where it looks like we 're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched Italian ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "An"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah there is something funny happening here because {disfmarker} yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "But there are thirty - six and then sometimes we are {disfmarker} we are {disfmarker} we are around forty - two and"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Now up"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "but"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Uh so one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a {disfmarker} a second um silence detection ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Yeah . So there are some results here"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "For the Italian ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "uh so the third and the fifth line of the table"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "For this one ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So filt is what that is ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Filt , yeah"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "Um yeah so it seems f for the {disfmarker} the well match and mismatched condition it 's uh it brings something . Uh but uh actually apparently there are {disfmarker} there 's no room left for any silence detector at the server side because of the delay .

Uh I guess it makes a l um at this point this is I {disfmarker} I guess I should probably look at these others a little bit uh And you {disfmarker} you yellowed these out uh but uh uh Oh I see yeah that {disfmarker} that one you can't use because of the delay .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So {disfmarker} so there 's {disfmarker} so I {disfmarker} I would put that one also as a {disfmarker} as a maybe .

While debugging efforts resulted in improved forced alignments, dealing with mixed channel speech and speaker overlap remains a key objective for future work. The group is additionally focused on a continued ability to feed different features into the recognizer and then train the system accordingly.

But , you know {disfmarker} So ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Cool . OK . So the s the {disfmarker} the next thing we had on the agenda was something about alignments ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Oh . Yes , we have {disfmarker} I don't know , did you wanna talk about it , or {disfmarker} ? I can give a {disfmarker} I was just telling this to Jane and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} W we {disfmarker} we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignments by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors {pause} that were occurring and um , some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition , which is a um , I think was both a {disfmarker} a pruning {pause} problem and possibly a problem with needing constraints on word locations . And so we tried both of these st things . We tried saying {disfmarker} I don't know , I got this {vocalsound} whacky idea that {disfmarker} just from looking at the data , that when people talk {pause} their words are usually chunked together . It 's not that they say one word and then there 's a bunch of words together . They 're {comment} might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels ? But in general , if there 's , like , five or six words and one word 's far away from it , that 's probably wrong on average . So , um {disfmarker} And then also , ca the pruning , of course , was too {disfmarker} too severe ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "So that 's actually interesting . The pruning was the same value that we used for recognition . And we had lowered that {disfmarker} we had used tighter pruning after Liz ran some experiments showing that , you know , it runs slower and there 's no real difference in {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Actually it was better with {disfmarker} slightly better or about th"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "No gain ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "it was the same with tighter pruning ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Right . So for free recognition , this {disfmarker} the lower pruning value is better ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "It 's probably cuz the recognition 's just bad en at a point where it 's bad enough that {disfmarker} that you don't lose anything ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "You {disfmarker} Correct . Right . Um , but it turned out for {disfmarker} for {disfmarker} to get accurate alignments it was really important to open up the pruning significantly ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Um {pause} because otherwise it would sort of do greedy alignment , um , in regions where there was no real speech yet from the foreground speaker ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Um , {vocalsound} so that was one big factor that helped improve things and then the other thing was that , you know , as Liz said the {disfmarker} we f enforce the fact that , uh , the foreground speech has to be continuous . It cannot be {disfmarker} you cannot have a background speech hypothesis in the middle of the foreground speech . You can only have background speech at the beginning and the end ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "Yeah . I mean , yeah , it isn't always true , and I think what we really want is some clever way to do this , where , um , you know , from the data or from maybe some hand - corrected alignments from transcribers that things like words that do occur just by themselves {pause} a alone , like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "those would be able to do that ,"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc C", "content": "Sorry ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "but the rest would be constrained . So , I think we have a version that 's pretty good for the native speakers . I don't know yet about the non - native speakers . And , um , we basically also made noise models for the different {disfmarker} sort of grouped some of the {pause} mouth noises together . Um , so , and then there 's a background speech model . And we also {disfmarker} There was some neat {disfmarker} or , interesting cases , like there 's one meeting where , {vocalsound} um , Jose 's giving a presentation and he 's talking about , um , the word \" mixed {pause} signal \" and someone didn't understand , uh , that you were saying \" mixed \" {disfmarker} I think , Morgan .

So there 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think there 's some issues about {disfmarker} u We probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker . But , I guess Andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker , and that 's actually a little bit of a f funky model . Like , it gives you some weird alignments , just because often the background speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Oh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "So there 's some things there ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD H", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "especially when you get lots of the same words , uh , occurring in the {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Well , the {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think you can do better by {vocalsound} uh , cloning {disfmarker} so we have a reject phone .
