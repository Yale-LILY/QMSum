We've received apologies for absence from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian and there is no substitute this morning. Can I ask if Members have got any declarations of interest they'd like to make, please? No? Okay. Thank you. Item 2 this morning, then, is a further session on our follow-up on our 'Mind over matter' report. I'm very pleased to welcome Carol Shillabeer, who is chief executive of Powys Teaching Health Board, and who manages the Together for Children and Young People programme. Thank you very much for attending, and thank you for the written update that you provided in advance to the committee. We've got a lot of ground that we want to cover this morning, so if it's okay we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start and ask you if you're satisfied with the progress that's been made since the programme was established in 2015."}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Thank you very much for that question, Chair. I've got to say 'yes', in many regards. So, the key focus of the programme in the early stages was about improving access to specialist child and adolescent mental health services. We developed the windscreen model\u2014or we lifted the windscreen model. Other models that are very similar have been talked about as well, and our big focus was on ensuring that we could make immediate progress around access to specialist CAMHS. It's some years ago now since this committee did the original report, and obviously Healthcare Inspectorate Wales and the Wales Audit Office had\u00a0done reports in the past, and I think there was a need for a programme that could focus on action. You'll see in the written update that we covered quite a large number of areas, and so therefore had to make a prioritisation. The prioritisation was at the specialist CAMHS end. We have provided the committee with a red, amber or green rating of where we feel that we were, and that was just before submission of the evidence. Overall I would say we have made progress. I recognise you recognise that in your 'Mind over matter' report, and that is pleasing. What I would say, though, is that there's a still a lot to be done. Certainly over the last nine months or so, we've seen a real momentum around the whole-school approach work, which we're not actually leading now as a programme, although we facilitated the workshop held in September. But that's got a real momentum, and the absolute priority now is the early help and enhanced support part of the work moving forward, and I'm sure we will come on to that in more detail. But we know there is more community workforce in specialist CAMHS, we know we're seeing children in a shorter time frame, and we know we're accepting more referrals, so our indicators are telling us we are making progress."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. And you referred to the work on the whole-school approach, which is very welcome, and I recognise that the programme has been involved in driving that as well. But I'm sure you'll also recognise the emphasis that the committee has placed on this being a whole-system approach to children and young people's mental health, and we feel very strongly that if any of the areas get out of balance, then it will jeopardise the progress in other parts of the programme. Are there any particular areas where you feel you haven't made enough progress that you'd like to draw the committee's attention to?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "This is maybe about what the programme's done, but really around the broader sense as well. I'm going to be very straight and say we should have made more progress on psychological therapies. I'm disappointed that we haven't. I'm assured that we've got capacity in place now and the drive in place to get the Matrics Cymru framework developed for children and young people. I've had discussions with the national psychological therapies committee, who have owned this, and we're working together more on this area. That's not to say for one minute that health boards and local areas haven't been working on psychological therapy service provision and changing the models, but that is an area we should have made, I think, earlier progress on. There's been a general reflection from myself and the Together for Children and Young People programme board over the phase of the programme. I think we started very strongly; I think we probably had a bit of a lull in the middle, if I'm truthful about that\u2014we had a change of personnel, and we really gathered a momentum over the last year or 18 months, and that has helped to push us from a focus on specialist CAMHS into that whole-school approach. But, if I could just agree with your comments about the whole system, it has to be the whole system and that's why the real focus now on early help and enhanced support is critical. If I can just say, in case I don't get a chance to say this later, I was delighted to see the focus on youth work yesterday, because what is clear is for that part, the early help and enhanced support, this isn't just about the NHS and it's not just about education, it's about every part of the system, really, which does make it more complex. But I just wanted to say that I think that youth work has perhaps not have the recognition that it's needed and yesterday was a positive step."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on early help and enhanced support from Janet Finch-Saunders."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. Good morning. In terms of local primary mental health support services, what is your understanding of the issues leading to some health boards not meeting the Mental Health (Wales) Measure 2010 targets for assessment and therapy for children and young people, and how much of this is due to an increase in demand?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Yes, thanks very much. So, it's important to say, I think, at the outset, just by way of reminder, that the target, quite rightly, changed for children and young people. The target changed some years ago for adults, so it was only right that there was an equalisation around children. So, the services were working, a couple of years ago, with significant demand and then a change in the standard. I think you're absolutely right; your question alludes to the fact that some health boards are struggling to maintain the full performance around seeing children, particularly within the 28 days. I would say\u2014. And we've had some discussion about whether the impact of the mental health Measure has actually drawn perhaps some of the workforce, the staff, who would have been working at that earlier stage in local primary mental health, into a bit more of the secondary element, which is why the review being undertaken by the NHS delivery unit into primary care CAMHS is so critical, because, actually, if we don't have\u2014and I believe we don't have\u2014enough capacity in that part of the system, then referrals will move towards the more specialist end of this. So, I think we will have seen, by the evidence submission, that demand has increased, not just in Wales but in the UK, and it has increased significantly. We are doing reasonably well at meeting that demand\u2014so, we have more contacts, more staff, shorter access times, so that is a good news story. We've not got it completely sustained at this stage, and therefore the focus of the delivery unit's primary care CAMHS report is what more can we do in that part of the system to help to see children and young people or provide consultation and liaison to others and support people at that level of intervention."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. I know, from my own experience as a constituency AM, I have families who tell me that they can't get into the early interventions and eventually things just become so\u2014they end up in the more specialist ones and believe that that's\u2014. And I don't like to put it in resource terms, but it's false economy in terms of the impact on the child and the family, but, obviously, in terms of cost as well. Do you find that that's a common theme across Wales?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Yes. I think that the thrust of that is absolutely right. So, we absolutely need to see children and families at the earliest intervention and that's why this is a whole system, not compartmentalised. I think there have been really good attempts in a couple of areas of that greater reach out and that earlier help\u2014hot clinics and those sorts of initiatives that help people not to get in a long queue for specialist CAMHS, but can be supported, often by telephone, at that earlier stage. My sense of where we go next, in terms of, you know, you talk about early help and enhanced support for all the 'missing middle', as you referred to it in your report, is to make sure we've got a fully joined-up, multi-agency team approach to that. And I think that will need some resourcing to support that, yet to be fully determined. But yesterday's announcement about youth work, the Government's commitment to primary care, CAMHS, et cetera\u2014that's all going to be very helpful to prevent those young people having to go into specialist CAMHS. And just a final note on that, if I may\u2014at the beginning of the programme, we had a report from Hafal called 'Making Sense' and there were 10 key asks, if you like, of the system and the service from young people who had experience of the service. They said, 'Please don't medicalise it'\u2014I'm paraphrasing now, of course\u2014'Please don't medicalise it; please focus on supporting teachers and others who can support us at an earlier stage and then, when we really need help, please ensure that it is there at that more specialist level.' That's been a bit of a guiding principle for the programme. So, that reflects the questions that you were asking, really."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. What are the outcomes of the stakeholder workshop held last week on early help and enhanced support? And how are the actions going to be taken forward and implemented? And also, given that the Together for Children and Young People programme comes to an end in October of this year, who, in your view, is best placed to forward this work stream, and what will be the biggest challenges? It's a bit of a long question, so, break it up however you like."}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "That's absolutely fine."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "And what will be the biggest challenges that they will face?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Yes, I think that's helpfully laid out in three stages. So, you're absolutely right, there was a highly successful workshop last week really focusing on early help and enhanced support. It brought all of the agencies together, which was\u2014and actually had a bit of a waiting list, apparently, for places. So, there was a lot of demand and a lot of interest in this. In relation to the next steps, there is a planning group reflection in early July, in terms of the outcomes of the workshop or the outputs of the workshop, and there are three commitments that have been made to this stage. One is that we develop those values-led approaches that will bring multiple agencies together to have that common purpose. The second one is to develop the ingredients for successful working in this area, and then, thirdly, to determine or propose priorities and sequencing of next steps. So, that's the next stage of that. I'm pretty sure we'll come on shortly\u2014or hopefully\u2014to the potential of the regional partnership boards. There is some work that we are doing as a programme with the children's commissioner in terms of working more with the regional partnership boards in taking forward this work. So, that will run alongside. But during the summer, then, we will be developing that framework approach, and we will be participating in the Association of Directors of Social Services conference in September, and then a follow-up workshop in October on this matter. On your question of 'Well, what happens after the programme?' we are currently working on legacy arrangements for the programme. I'm pretty secure on the specialist CAMHS element. That will move, most likely, to the CAMHS network, which is part of the NHS mental health network. I actually chair the mental health network and that's one part of that. The whole-school approach element is already settled in Government and we've got a connection in to that. The question that's outstanding is where the early help and enhanced support and the neurodevelopmental will go. I am currently in discussions with Welsh Government officials around that. I can be very clear of my own view that there needs to be a confident and clear legacy arrangement for this work. We cannot afford that we've come so far for this not now to proceed. I think there's a huge momentum behind this. I don't see there would be any obstacles\u2014I hope\u2014in getting that commitment translated into a strong approach, as we move forward. So, I'm not in a position to say, 'And the legacy arrangements will be\u2014', but I am in a position to say that I'm having those discussions with Welsh Government officials. They know my view that we've got to put something in place that is strong and secure as we move forward, and I believe that they are supportive of that."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Janet, I think those two questions have been touched on, the remaining questions. We are going to discuss in more detail the legacy arrangements, but if I could just ask on psychological therapies: you referred to the fact that you were a bit disappointed with progress in this area, and the area hasn't been directly led on by the Together for Children and Young People programme. Do you think that means now that there is more of a threat to progress in this area, because, you know, we've got different compartmentalising of actions, and this is absolutely key, isn't it, really?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Yes. I think there's\u2014. There is some refinement to be done, I think, in making sure the connections are there. So, I think, as we move to programme end, we'll want to be absolutely assured that there are no strands left hanging, so to speak. I am confident\u2014I mentioned the mental health network board that I chair\u2014that we have those strands nailed down, but recognising that the early help and enhanced support and the provision of psychological support is beyond the NHS. So, this will be an area that needs to be very much seen as a key part of that. My own sense is that\u2014. There's been quite a lot of other developments through the life of the programme. So, in the evidence that I've provided, you'll see the First 1000 days, all the adverse childhood experiences work, the Cymru Well Wales partnership, et cetera, et cetera. So, there is a bit of what I would call tidying up of the landscape to be done, and this is the ideal opportunity to do that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. We've got some questions now on specialist CAMHS\u2014if I can just ask about the impact of the specialist CAMHS framework, and how effective you feel that has been in promoting a consistent delivery of care for young people."}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Thanks very much for that. Without wanting to go back too far in history, I remember coming into this area back in 2014 as I was asked to establish a CAMHS network. My observation was there wasn't really a strong and well-connected clinical community in this area. When we spin forward five years, I can confidently say that there is a strong and well-connected clinical community around specialist CAMHS. The programme has helped; the emphasis and the focus of the programme has helped to bring people together with that more common endeavour\u00a0to understand, actually, there is a good case for consistency in the main, with local variation. There has been a case for much greater learning between organisations. If I just give you an example\u2014you'll know that the community intensive service teams were put in place in 2015-ish. Some areas have them, but a lot of areas didn't. We do have inconsistency in that, but the consistent part is there is a service now right the way across Wales for more intensive support to children and young people and their families in their own homes, which helps to prevent admissions and then, where there are admissions, helps to support people to be at home. They're all called slightly different things. So, I might have referred in my papers to CITT, CATT, COT and CITE. So, they've all got slightly different names and they've got slightly different opening hours. The key thrust of this is that there is a backbone, if you like, of a consistent approach with that local variation. We have to check. So, things like frameworks for improvement\u2014there is a coming together of the clinicians and the professionals to agree what that framework for improvement is. That then gets implemented, with some local variation. So, I think the process of moving in that way has been extremely helpful. There will be some variation. We want some variation, to some extent, as places try new things and evaluate new things. So, if I just refer to the previous question that I had, and I talked about hot clinics and different ways of reaching out; that's been tried in one area, been evaluated\u2014let's see the spread of that. So, you'll know my view on internet counselling, for example; I feel that is quite a strong offer for children\u2014not necessarily in the specialist end.\u00a0If that works in one area, why aren't we rolling that out to other areas? So, I think the framework for improvement has provided a vehicle for those clinicians and professionals to come together. It's in a stronger place\u2014a much stronger place\u2014than it was five years ago."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. You've referred to there being some inconsistencies in terms of crisis care, but are you able to assure the committee that all young people are now getting at least a consistent service, especially in terms of interventions in the instances of young people self-harming. Wherever you live in Wales, is that help there for you now?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Well, in your work to produce the 'Mind over matter' report, I clearly listened to the views from the police and the recommendations in relation to the police. We've taken that as a further piece of work under the specialist CAMHS umbrella, to truly understand what the experiences of the police are and what some of the root issues may be in relation to that. For example, is it that because the CIT, CAT, COT, CITE\u2014the community intensive service\u2014closes at 10 o'clock in a certain area, that actually it's after that that the network of support isn't as strong, and, if that is the case, what are we going to do about that? There's certainly potential in working more regionally or even working between adults' and children's in terms of the crisis resolution services that work beyond those hours. So, we are taking an extra look at this, because I could not be 100 per cent confident that, throughout the 24-hour period, we've got this fully settled. I continue to hear some stories from the police that they are picking up young people and feeling that they've not got that solid place to go, and we're following those through."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now from Hefin David on neurodevelopmental services."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I think, Chair, I should have declared an interest here, as my daughter has been diagnosed with autism and is currently going through the process of receiving neurodevelopmental speech and language support particularly. We're seeing an increase in neurodevelopmental referrals, and that will increase further in the future. Can you give us an explanation as to why this demand is growing and how we're going to meet capacity to deliver and for support for those children?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Thank you. They're very big questions in terms of 'why'. I'm not sure that anyone really knows why, if I'm honest, although there is a lot of academic research going on. What we do know is that we are starting to see the scale of those referrals coming through. So, in the information provided, I refer to the NHS digital prevalence report in England, which indicates that about 5.5 per cent of two to four-year-olds have a mental disorder. Now, that sounds a bit shocking when we say that, but that's in the international classification scaling, and, of that, certainly, 2.5 per cent is around autism. I can just testify, in real life, that demand is absolutely growing. So, if I just take my own health board for a moment, we usually have about 75 referrals per year. Last year we had 300. So, that has felt very difficult to manage. If I can just give you a sense of what we've done so far and then what I think is next, I want to recognise the work of Dr Cath Norton and the steering group that's been established on neurodevelopmental issues under the programme. They had a standing start. They've done a lot of very, very good work. We now have seven teams in place across Wales. We now have a national pathway. We now have a community-of-practice-type environment, and we're really getting into this. Good progress has been made. More people have been seen. More people have been assessed. So, we have made progress. But I've got a long list of considerations that I think respond to your question. One is that most referrals that come through, the clinicians tell me, are seeking support to move through what they perceive to be a gateway for educational support. So, that is often the reason why people come. Now, that is obviously going to be linked to\u00a0the whole-school approach and how we can support that. Demand is outstripping supply. So, our clinical teams are concerned about how do they keep up. So, if I just take my own example of 300 in the last year, we're looking to try and put some additional capacity in to support seeing those families, but also then to understand what the long-term trajectory is going to be. Because we've put these teams in, because we've got the new pathway, has that opened a gate and we've got a lot of backlog or is that the pattern?"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Can I just ask a question there?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, with regard to the 75 to 300 increase\u2014in the space of a year was that?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "In a year, yes."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Did you anticipate that or was that something that just came totally unexpected?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "I think we anticipated a few more, and just to say that in my\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But not on that scale."}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "No, not on that scale. And in my own health board\u2014I'm just referring to my own, and I'm happy to share the information on this\u2014we already had a service in place. So, it wasn't as if we had nothing in place previously. We had a NICE-compliant service already in place, but we knew we needed to expand that, which we have done, but we didn't anticipate 300. So, this is happening not just across Wales, actually, but across the UK\u2014so, this greater recognition, the desire for families coming forward to access that support and them seeing this as a route, which is really important. What I would also say, and this is part of the bigger picture that we need to consider going forward, is that only about 40 per cent to 50 per cent of those families that come forward have what I would call or the clinicians would call a diagnosis\u2014so, a threshold or whatever term you want to use that takes people through to that educational support. So, we've got a lot of people who are under that threshold, but that's a lot of people who still need help and support. I'm trying to very fairly and, I hope, appropriately represent the very strong views coming from the group\u2014the workstream under the programme. We've got to tackle all of that. It's not going to be good enough for us just to focus our attention on those children and young people and their families who reach a threshold, because there are needs elsewhere as well, and some of that will overlap with the early help and enhanced support. Some of that overlaps with learning disability services. Can I just mention a few more things, as I'm on roll on neurodevelopmental?"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "It's up to the Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Yes, go on."}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Is that all right? Sorry, I know it's a very long answer. There is a concern from the neurodevelopmental group to get across that whilst there has been a lot of focus on autism\u2014and we recognise the private Member's Bill\u2014there are other neurodevelopmental presentations and there's a real\u2014. Having the broadest view would be advised by them, and I think they're particularly keen to understand what a future vision and what we call, say, a 'perfect world' would look like. That's the piece of work that we're wanting to do now. In terms of giving advice at the end of the programme and into legacy arrangements, about what the big, big things are, we are still needing to tackle."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I mean, I personally took a very personal decision when it came to the Member's Bill on autism you were talking about\u2014and that was the advice I received. You need to look at the wider symptoms that are presented beyond autism and other neurological conditions. So, I'm glad you said that, because it gives me\u2014. Because I didn't vote for that Bill, and I'm glad you said that because it gives me some personal reassurance there. But what I do have concerns about is if the increase wasn't anticipated to the extent that it was and that the Together for Children and Young People programme has a duty to review capacity, after October who's going to make sure that that capacity's reviewed on a strategic basis?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "So, I should have probably added in that we've got a piece of work under way at the moment\u2014Welsh Government commissioned it\u2014by a person called Patrick Holton, and he is specifically looking at the demands on capacity in relation to neurodevelopmental. I think getting that slightly more independent view of what we think the trends are going to be over the long term will mean we can plan for the long term. We know that money's been put into this and it has had an important impact, but we now need to be planning for the next three, five, 10 and many years beyond that. There is the integrated autism service. I think there are some conversations, when I talk about the landscape being quite busy, about the sense of where this links as we support people through their lives with a neurodevelopmental issue. So, it's not just about a childhood thing; as people move through, we've got to get much better at that long-term planning. So, that piece of work is really important. We will get the report of that over the next couple of months in order for this sort of perfect-world picture that we want to try to describe to be informed by that. It also connects to the early help and enhanced support, because recognising if we just say half of the people who come for an assessment don't meet a threshold for a certain category, that's a lot of people who will need help and support to manage and cope with their condition and their situation."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. If we can just move on now to in-patient care, and if I can just ask you what the programme has been doing to address some of the challenges and opportunities we face in terms of CAMHS in-patient care, particularly in light of the restrictions that are in place in Abergele and T\u0177 Llidiard."}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Yes, thank you very much for that question. Again, quite a lot of progress has been made in the early part of the programme around in-patients, and you are very well aware of the challenges over the last year or 18 months in relation to both units. I think, certainly, there is some recovery in the position in north Wales, and the programme did a peer review visit to north Wales, which I think was very helpful. In terms of where the programme has been on this issue, there is some work under way, at quite an advanced stage, around the art of the possible around enhancing the scope of the services. This was quite a tricky thing to start off when you're in a position where, actually, there've been some restrictions, to then ask the service to think about going even further, but we really wanted to see what the art of the possible would be if we could attract the right workforce, get the right environment, et cetera, et cetera\u2014so, that piece of work, the review of the specification about what could be possible. Clearly, we work very closely with Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee as the commissioner, so we don't commission that. We neither performance manage those environments. But, if I can just say, probably the most important part of moving forward now is the longer term work between health and social care in terms of having a much more integrated and joined up approach for children. We believe there would probably be about 100 children who have experienced care in multiple settings. We haven't got that mature approach in terms of these being joined-up teams; we've got social care and we've got healthcare. There is a growing appetite to do something different. There is a meeting with the children's commissioner on 9 July to explore that. I've previously had conversations with the chief inspector of Care Inspectorate Wales, for example, and we have now got, I think, a consensus growing that we need to do something very different for children and young people who are in this sort of need for the future. We also know that there've been some high-profile legal cases as well. So, we've got to move to that step now. It has been largely successful, the work that has taken place over recent years, but not without its key challenges."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. And, just briefly on the new specification that WHSSC are developing, that will enable admissions at weekends and out of hours. How concerned should we be about that being a challenge, particularly in Abergele, where staffing has been a major issue?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Yes. I think we need to be very mindful of ensuring that the right workforce are in place before that gets implemented. The peer review highlighted the challenge of the physical environment, where the unit is, the challenge across north Wales of the workforce. These are issues well known by the health board, by the way, so it wasn't a surprise to them.\u00a0But that dialogue about how do we ensure that we've got the right workforce, because that unit, potentially, could\u2014you know, it's an isolated unit, and they\u2019ve been risk-managing. They've been managing the types of young people that they can take bearing in mind the workforce that they've got available, and that's been entirely the right thing to do. But the downside of that is it's not as accessible as we would want."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Hefin David has got some questions on workforce now."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Yes. With regard to the increased CAMHS posts that have been made available between 2016 and 2018\u2014a 62 per cent increase in CAMHS posts\u2014we know that there's likely to be labour market demand, high labour market demand, in those instances, so are the vacancy rates higher in Wales than elsewhere, given the increase in those posts to be filled?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "So, you're absolutely right. There's been quite a lot of investment, and there have been quite a lot of new recruits coming to the service. We had in the early days a situation where we were largely robbing Peter to pay Paul, to be quite frank. So, as new services were being developed, people would move from one part of the system to the other. So, in the early days there was little net gain. That has improved slightly, but we're in a national context, particularly around nursing and around some specialties in medicine, of a national shortage, so this is not a quick fix. We are starting to see a greater diversity of workforce. So, if I can mention psychology assistants, for example, my own health board is employing more psychology assistants as part of a skill mix team, rather than going to where we might have been more traditionally based. We see some of that through the NHS benchmarking, particularly with England. They have more of that. We're perhaps a little bit\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "More of what?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "They have more skill mix in their workforce. We're catching up a bit more on that now."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Just to clarify there, what you're referring to\u2014there are more nursing and medical staff in the Wales system and more psychological staff, experts, in the UK picture. Is that\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "In the England picture. So, England had a programme called IAPT, which is about psychological therapies, and had therefore looked at the skill mix. Some of that was\u2014. We've chatted to colleagues in England, trying to learn\u2014we're all trying to make improvements in this area, of course; it's a UK and international issue\u2014what were their experiences of this psychological therapies approach. Because of their vacancies they had to skill mix, and because of the money that they had available\u2014they didn't have as much of a cash injection as perhaps we've been able to secure. So, they skill mixed much earlier; we're skill mixing now. We're using different types of roles, for example. And if I can just make a plea, really, around recognising the input of the third sector\u2014so, it doesn't always have to be an NHS-employed person to work in service provision, direct front-line service provision, and the third sector are offering a significant contribution in a number of areas of our services. And that is one that we will need to cultivate, because, to be quite frank, our recruitment challenges won't be solved overnight. We've recognised that the commissioning numbers for nursing and other professionals have gone up over recent times, but, with the training time, it's not a quick fix."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Does the workforce profile remain different, or are they starting to\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "They're starting to come together. There is a\u2014graph 13 in terms of the CAMHS profile. Each year we do the NHS benchmarking, and we can see where we are compared to others, and I would expect over the next year or two that we see a bit more narrowing."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, if you compare a child in Wales with a child in England in the last two years who's been through this, would they have had a different experience as a result, and different clinical advice as a result, or is there consistency despite the difference in workforce profile?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "That's quite a big question. Hand on heart, could I tell you I absolutely know the detail of that? No, I couldn't.\u00a0The practice in this area is guided by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance, so it's pretty much guided. We would expect all of our practitioners to be able to work to NICE guidance. When you skill mix a team, you enable the right referrals to go to the right person, so you wouldn't necessarily have a child or young person with particularly complex needs\u2014well, you would match them to the right practitioner for their needs. So, it does\u2014. And we've seen some of that; if I just make reference to the panel approach in Gwent that's been developed, a multi-agency panel come together, a referral comes in, it's then about matching the right service and the right person to the needs that are being presented. So, we can be much more flexible in relation to that, and we have to be careful to use the right resource for the right person, because, if we've got a resource that is highly specialist, we want them to be dealing with those children and young people."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And one of the things you're able to do\u2014because there's a lot about the labour market you can't control, but one of the things you can control is workforce development and ongoing workforce development. You've mentioned communities of practice. What other things are being done in addition, and how do the communities of practice work might be a good question, but what else is being done in order to upskill and develop and grow the existing workforce that is presented to you?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Thank you for that. So, there's a couple of things around\u2014. I think there's a huge focus on staff retention now, not just in Wales but across the UK. So, we've got recruitment but we've got retention. What are the factors that affect retention? Actually, well-being, well-being at work\u2014and you'll know that within 'A Healthier Wales' the focus on staff engagement, staff well-being, has been laid out\u2014the ability to work well in teams and the culture of organisations and services, and, then, as you rightly say, training and development and career opportunities. So, the developments over the last few years have brought training opportunities and career development opportunities as well. I think the community of practice\u2014it's something that has become a bit of a standard now across these areas\u2014actually brings people together doing collective audit, doing collective reflection on service improvement, and being very clear about learning from one another. And, if you're a clinician, that gives you a lot of motivation to keep driving forward. So, I think we have the fundamental building blocks in place, but there is more to do around the environment in which our practitioners and our staff operate."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "What about the Welsh language in the health board?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Thank you very much. There are two elements, if I may, just on that. In your report of last year you highlighted the need to do further work on the use of the Welsh language, and have we got enough Welsh language practitioners where we need them. We are doing that piece of work. I'm pleased to say that, over the last few years, I think all health boards have really stepped up in terms of being able to understand the levels of Welsh speaking amongst employed staff and where their Welsh-speaking communities are. We're particularly looking at it in terms of in-patient CAMHS and community intensive services, because, particularly when people are feeling at their most vulnerable, they would choose the language they wish to choose. So, we know we need to respond to that. So, we will be in a position to, by the end of this programme, provide that position statement on what happens next. I would also say, of course, we've got the Welsh language standards that we are all working on at the moment, and we've got a very clear programme of when we have to be compliant with those standards. So, that element is very high on the priority list."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Suzy Davies has a question about looked-after children."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes. Thank you, Chair. Obviously, everything you've been speaking about already, particularly about workforce development, applies to children in care as well, where there's other work also going on in terms of support. Can you give us some indication about how the programme intersects, then, with the outcomes for the children in care work programme?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Thanks very much for that. So, we have one of our members of the programme board also sitting on the outcomes for children ministerial group, which is good. So, we've got that cross-link. We also have a director of social services on our programme board and, obviously, they're very clearly linked in to the outcomes for children. I just made reference to, under the question on specialist CAMHS in-patients, the need to bring those services together, and that, really, is the need for much stronger working between the outcomes for children group and the Together for Children and Young People programme and the constituent parts. So, I'm confident that that has been pegged now. We've got a way forward and there is a consensus that we need to do things together on that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Can you just perhaps give us an example of how that then looks on the ground? Because it's great that people are talking together, but how would that affect, I don't know, individual members of the workforce, or, indeed, the children we're talking about?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Yes. So, if I just give an example of a unit in south Wales that is a social care unit, we've been having discussions about, 'Well, actually, shouldn't you have a psychologist and good access to psychological therapies, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera?' So, we haven't yet got an agreed position on how we're going to do this, but the position is that something needs to be done, and there is an appetite for and an understanding of the case for change, I believe. But what it will mean, I think, in practice, is that you get much more fluid roles moving across sectors, or we could be designing services that are fully integrated. Now, there may be challenges in that, but, you know, let's get them out on the table. So, in terms of this seamless health and social care system for Wales, this is one of the tests of that, I would say: can we, within the next five years, 10 years, really bring that together? That will take quite a lot of work and commitment.  On the looked-after children specifically, we have picked that up, particularly following your previous report, looking specifically at the assessment of young people who are care experienced who are in the system. Absolutely, part of the health assessment is emotional health and mental health. We are questioning whether that needs to be a greater part and what the level of support needs to be, particularly because of the backgrounds of children that have led them to be in those circumstances. That's a core piece of work under the early help and enhanced support work stream, and we'll be ensuring that that is complete by the end of the programme."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. And you're confident that that will reach children who are being fostered and perhaps don't have very frequent looked-after children reviews, because, from all other perspectives, things are going fairly well."}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Yes. And, of course, there's the edge-of-care work that the Government have been supporting, and, certainly in my own area, under the regional partnership board, we have a Start Well programme, which is the old Children and Young People's Partnership programme, where there's a significant investment in supporting children and young people, families, on the edge of care, which does pick up fostering."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Ah, lovely. Thank you. Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Dawn has a question on transition."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Yes. Thank you, Chair. We've heard, not necessarily just in the context of this report, because we've heard similar evidence around transition arrangements in another committee report when we did the suicide prevention, and I've in fact only recently\u2014well, just this week, actually\u2014met with community mental health teams in my constituency, and there is still some concern about transitional arrangements from children into adult services. Now, I know we had the\u2014. The transition guidance was published a couple of years ago now, and the programme was involved in developing that guidance. But what's your assessment of the impact that it's had? Because we clearly are still seeing people falling through the gaps, aren't we?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Yes, thank you for that. You're absolutely right; we developed that guidance and we are currently in the process of the evaluation of that. And, in particular, I know that the children's commissioner is very focused on transition, not just around children in receipt of emotional mental health support, but children in paediatric wards, and there is a working group with Welsh Government looking at this.  The children's commissioner has used our guidance to put that on the table to say, 'Well, if this works, this needs to be considered as a model for using elsewhere'. But the big question there is 'if'. So, we do want to get evaluation. If I were just to give an estimate of where I think this will land, I think it will have made improvements, but there may well be some further work to do in enhancing, supporting, auditing that every child is supported in line with that guidance. So, I talked about community practice and clinical audit: is this something that we make, then, a mandatory audit, each year, that we do that double check?\u00a0Because it's one of those things where we know when a child is 14, 15, 16, 17, so what's stopping us? If indeed the evaluation says it's not happening everywhere, it's not happening early enough, what is stopping us? We really need to get underneath that. So, my sense will be it will show us, it will be better, but there's some further work to do, and following that up in terms of audit and making sure that we've got a systematic approach to dealing with those who haven't had the guidance fully implemented, because it can make a real difference."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Yes, and it seems to me\u2014you've just talked about having a systematic approach, and it does seem to me that it is a systematic process, isn't it? So, it shouldn't be difficult. I know we're talking about in the health service things shouldn't be difficult and they are, and one of the gripes\u2014I had a meeting with the community health team\u2014was the problems of the new IT systems and so on\u2014let's not go there at the moment. But, really, this is just about referring children and having a smooth transition from the service being provided to them as a child and then just shifting it over to the adult services. It shouldn't be difficult. It's really difficult to get my head around why that is such a problem and why that needs to be so difficult."}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Can I add one other dimension in, which I think is going to be quite interesting? We talk about transitions being an issue\u2014and we know it's not just in mental health, but it's elsewhere\u2014then you start to think, 'What if we could reduce transitions?', so you reduce the number of transitions and you manage them better. We are doing a piece of work with Government on the potential to explore what a 0-25-type service would be. We know that in different places they have approached that\u2014in Australia and places in the UK. There are probably some pros and cons, but should we be moving to a 0-25. That is moving the transition at the age of 25, but at least it's not at the eighteenth birthday. What's the argument around what adolescent, young people and young adults services are, for example? That piece of research and understanding\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "You could probably have a gradual transition, then, couldn't you?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Quite potentially. I've got some people who have joined my own health board who've worked in that 0-25-type service, and we're catching up\u2014'Tell me what was good about it? Tell me what was not so good about it? What did the young people themselves think about that?'. Because if we can manage down the numbers of transitions, there really should be no excuse not to get transitions right, then."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. We've got some really important questions now about legacy, because throughout the session this morning you've referred to ongoing work, really, and that is a major concern for the committee. Suzy Davies."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, thank you, Chair, we are a little bit worried that this programme is coming to an end in a matter of months when perhaps its work's not been completed. Obviously, we've got the Welsh Government's strategy for mental health running until 2022, which is a few years longer. Can you tell me whether you think your programme needs to continue, perhaps even if it's just for the same length of time as Together for Mental Health, or is its work done and it needs to be picked up now by a different system?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Thank you for that. Can I just say, I've given this so much thought over the time, because I think you might have asked me this question when I came previously? There are two ways to look at this. I'm absolutely sure that the issue of children's emotional and mental health will be one that will be with us for a very long time. We have made a lot of progress, I think, as a society, in talking about this now. We talk about mental health so much more than we ever used to. When I was a child, we never talked about it. I talk to my own children and say, 'What's going on in your lives at school?', and they talk about this. This is not an issue, if you like, that I believe you can pick up and solve literally in five years. This is one for the long term for us. So, on the one hand, I think my view last year was that, when you have a programme of work, you should have a start, a middle and end, really\u2014otherwise it's not a programme of work, it's almost forever\u2014and there is a moment to refresh and reflect on whether that mechanism has done all it should and it should move into a different mechanism. So, my position last year was, 'This will have been running for five years\u2014we've done a lot of work and made progress on specialist CAMHS, we have made progress on the whole-school approach and there is a different mechanism for this' et cetera. My position now is I want to just be really sure and secure that there is a strong arrangement going forward that takes this work, if this programme is going to close."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Are you sure?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Not yet. So, I think, in an earlier question I indicated dialogue going on between myself and Welsh Government officials. I don't think there's a barrier\u2014people aren't saying, 'No, it all needs to just stop; we've solved the issue', but the exact nature of the legacy arrangements, particularly for early help and enhanced support, are not yet fully determined, or for neurodevelopmental. If it was a choice between nothing being there and continuing this programme, I would be supporting continuing the programme. I don't think we can stop now."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, I don't think any of us would disagree with that, but I suppose there might be a level of concern that the Welsh Government's preferred route from now on would be through the regional partnership boards and public services boards. You mentioned that you've done that work in Gwent, down in the south-east of your patch there. It's quite difficult for us to try and get a picture of how that will work successfully for the whole of Wales. I know you've got your experience in Gwent, but have you thought a bit more about how it might look elsewhere, if that's the route that Government decides to pursue?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "Yes. I think the key question in my own mind is: are the regional partnership boards yet ready and mature enough to take this forward? I'm the chair of the Powys regional partnership board, so I should declare that. There's a lot being asked of the regional partnership boards at the moment\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, we'll be asking them to go with the 'Mind over matter' report, to make sure that that's delivered upon."}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "There's a lot, you know, 'A Healthier Wales'\u2014. Everyone does feel that the regional partnership boards are a route to really secure multi-agency working, so there is quite a high expectation. My understanding\u2014and this is a rather informal understanding\u2014is that different RPBs are in different places. So, some have retained what used to be the old children and young people partnerships, and perhaps where they have been retained, they may be in a more progressed position. Some are looking to have to re-establish those. So, my sense of this is that, I think, possibly the RPBs aren't yet in that position to be ready. Our piece of work on early help and enhanced support, in terms of your earlier question about what's the commitment\u2014that feels that that may well be another year or 18 months of development work, alongside the RPB development work, to get that ready, before we can then more confidently say where we can hand over."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "You may not feel able to say it, then, but would be wrong in saying that, actually, it would be quite a good idea to extend the current programme, just to make sure that anyone else who might be able to run on with component parts of it is in the position to do that to our satisfaction?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "I'm happy to respond to it. My sense is that, whether it's the programme or whether it's something else, something needs to be there. The next stage is really multi-agency, so it may well be that the programme currently has been NHS-led\u2014maybe it needs to be led elsewhere, maybe not. I think there's a view that this needs to continue. I'm less wedded to it having to be the Together for Children and Young People programme. It may be seen as a convenient mechanism\u2014it's already established, we've got a programme team et cetera, so it may be seen as a ready sort of solution. I'm not wedded to that. What I feel strongly about is that we've got to have the right mechanism to take it forward."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Can I just push you on one thing there? You mentioned, perhaps, the NHS could lead on the work, for example. Is there a risk of fragmentation if we start looking\u2014? I'm just thinking\u2014I mean, we've got the elements here: we've got the NHS, there's the whole-school approach, early help and enhanced support and intervention, as you mentioned earlier. If that goes to one of the players in that multi-agency approach, is there a risk that they might become too dominant, inadvertently\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "If I can just clarify\u2014apologies if I wasn't clear. I said the current programme has been NHS-led, and that might be a reason to change."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "To mix it up a bit. Oh, right, okay. Anything else you want me to pursue on that\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Can I just clarify for the record, Carol\u2014because we put this to the Minister last week\u2014are you looking at asking the regional partnership boards to take this work over from October 2019? Are you saying clearly to the committee that you do not feel that all regional partnership boards are ready for that challenge at this point?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "I'm saying that on a more, if you like it, uniformed and informal basis, we're doing some work with the children's commissioner now in terms of\u2014. I know the children's commissioner's very interested in how RPBs are managing, developing and dealing with the issues of children and young people's concerns. We're working with her to understand and to mirror alongside her the understanding of the RPBs. What I would say is that there has been some preparatory work by Government around supporting RPBs. So, for example, in the integrated care fund guidance last year, there was a specific reference to child and adolescent emotional mental health, which I welcomed. I've also welcomed, literally last week, a letter to all RPB chairs giving an allocation of \u00a3200,000 per RPB to support this further work in terms of child and adolescent emotional and mental health and the early help and support element. So, all of these things are in the right direction. My sense, and I need to stress it's a sense because we haven't done that piece of work, is different RPBs are in different places. So, how confident can we be at the October date that we could hand over? My sense is, just to safeguard, having a mechanism in place for the next 12 to 18 months to guide this through might be advisable, and that's what I'm talking to officials about."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "And that would either be an extension of the Together for Children and Young People programme or something else. Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you. Because I think there is a question, isn't there, about whether the RPBs will make this enough of a priority? I'm a bit nervous that it might get lost in that huge amount of work you said they might have. Just a final question from me: how are you establishing what the young people themselves think about the end of the programme? Are they bothered about the structure of this at all or are they just concerned that they're getting help? How's the stakeholder group feeding into this?"}, {"speaker": "Carol Shillabeer", "content": "I've not been blown over in the rush of people saying, 'Don't go anywhere.' [Laughter.] It's a really important matter for young people. I know that later on you're meeting with the Youth Parliament, you're having a joint session, which is fantastic. We've had contact with the Youth Parliament because we know it's one of their top three issues. So, it runs in the vein of that this is going to be a long-term matter for young people, I think. Whether they have a specific view on the programme, I don't know. I've not heard that. But I'm pretty sure they will be vocal in saying, 'We have to have these developments continue.'\u00a0It is a major issue, we're not there yet\u2014maybe some progress has been made but there's still a lot to do\u2014and I think we'll need to be able to respond to that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Anything particularly you want in addition to that?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "No, I think that's fine.

Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Welsh Youth Parliament\u2014invitation to engagement events. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Minister for Education clarifying some issues around the Welsh network of healthy schools scheme, following the task and finish group. Paper to note 3: letter from the Minister for Education on the implementation of the Diamond reforms, and that's ahead of our session on 4 July. Papers to note 4 and 5 are a letter from me to the children's commissioner and the Minister for Education seeking the update we agreed on the issue of elective home education. And then paper to note 6, paper to note 7 and paper to note 8 are all letters regarding the concerns that we discussed about the expectation of a target being set for looked-after children, to the First Minister, Children's Commissioner for Wales and the Association of Directors of Social Services. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you very much. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to resolve to exclude the public for the remainder of the meeting. Are Members content?

In this meeting, the Minister for Education, Kirsty and Director of Education, Steve answered many specific questions and expressed their opinions about the current situations. Altogether, they had talked about the school categorization system which has been used right now, the curriculum reform, changes and challenges. Also, they spent lots of time discussing regional consortia services that the way it worked and how they could be improved. Although now they failed to persuade the government to adopt the new model, they were optimistic about the future application."}], "specific_query_list": [{"query": "Summarize the discussion about schools causing concern with questions from Irranca-Davies.", "answer": "According to Kirsty, there were a variety of ways in which schools that needed support or needed to be challenged on their practice would be identified. Basically, they relied on the school categorization system. What's more, in Kirsty's opinion, the school improvement service was a risk-based approach. Luckily, the categorization system on which they depended would continue to evolve to align itself to the curriculum reform and make changes in self-evaluation. It would continue to evolve because it had to be consistent with their overall approach to school improvement and raising standards. What they needed now was a more strategic, longer term approach to reach changes in a school rather than some of the easy-to-fix items that made a school as if it was doing better.", "relevant_text_span": [["27", "56"]]}, {"query": "What was the method of holding schools and their governing bodies to account for their practice and for the work that they did?", "answer": "Now, Estyn was used as part of the accountability system. Since the systems were evolving all the time, the Estyn itself inspection regime was changing as well. Now, they were moving to a system where Estyn would be more regularly in schools. Although there were two systems, they were different and they looked at different things. The categorization system they used now was how they looked for those ways of identifying support for schools.", "relevant_text_span": [["27", "28"]]}, {"query": "How could the schools that are causing significant concern be identified?", "answer": "According to Kirsty and Huw, the real question was how was it that they didn't identify those schools. Since these schools were not being identified early enough, there was a need to do something urgently about these concerns, particularly in secondary schools. Even though they had identified them as needing that extra help, they were not moving at pace away from that system. In Steve's opinion, the importance lied on \"What about the schools that are sliding in that direction?\" And it brought together what they knew from Estyn, but also, local authorities had knowledge of their schools, and so did consortia. They had got to be better at bringing those together.", "relevant_text_span": [["31", "35"]]}, {"query": "What was a level that Kirsty would be content with of having schools in red category in Wales?", "answer": "According to Kirsty, school was going to need a little bit of extra support, so it was not always just a crisis that needed extra support. There were just general things that happen in the life of a school that could lead to it. However, it was also right that they had a particular challenge in the secondary sector. That's why they had introduced the new pilot to address those schools. If they carried on doing the same thing, they would keep getting the same results, which was not satisfying enough.", "relevant_text_span": [["53", "56"]]}, {"query": "Summarize the discussion about the attitudes and opinions on the work of consortia.", "answer": "According to Hefin, some regional consortia services performed really highly, but there were others that needed to improve. Those consortia shall be seen as working together on a national approach, but being delivered on a regional basis. Also, it had evolved over time, and they were constantly looking for optimum delivery. By taking Education through Regional Working as an example, they had pointed out that ERW as well as the Education Achievement Service EAS was constituted in a different way to the Central South Consortium. They delivered on a regional basis. They would continue to discuss with ERW what was the optimal way and continued to cooperate with the constituent local authorities about how that shall be organized.", "relevant_text_span": [["57", "81"]]}, {"query": "Why did they take Education through Regional Working as an example?", "answer": "In Hefin's opinion, they took ERW as an example because it did things differently with regard to the four consortia. They were interested in the effectiveness of that organization to deliver for children and for teachers since ERW had got particular challenges. What they were seeing the national consortia do is developing a national approach to school improvement services. What's more, according to Hefin, the regional consortia were not a beast of the Government; they were a beast of the local authorities that had worked together to create a school improvement service that met their needs.", "relevant_text_span": [["67", "70"]]}, {"query": "What's their opinion in intervening Neath Port Talbot and ERW about addressing the issue of safeguarding their schools?", "answer": "Kirsty believed that it was really important for them to understand how Neath Port Talbot intended to support their schools and their teachers if they were to withdraw from ERW, especially at what was a critical time. They wanted to know from Neath Port Talbot how they were going to do that without being part of the organization. Additionally, Kirsty was curious about how they were going to safeguard their schools and make sure that the children who were receiving their education in Neath Port Talbot were not disadvantaged if they were to follow through on that decision.", "relevant_text_span": [["70", "72"]]}, {"query": "What's their role in intervening Neath Port Talbot and ERW about addressing the issue of safeguarding their schools?", "answer": "According to Kirsty, they would be \"seeking assurances\". It meant that Neath Port Talbot would need to demonstrate to them how they were going to address these problems. However, so far, they had not seen the plans. But if Neath Port Talbot were to push forward and follow on the notice, they would want to see. Now, what they were doing was waiting for their responses.", "relevant_text_span": [["73", "81"]]}, {"query": "Summarize the discussion about actions towards the document in 2015-\"National model for regional working\".", "answer": "According to Kirsty, it was the current model. Although they failed to persuade the local government to adopt a new national model, the local authorities had already seen the value in it. However, they were at the stage looking to a wholesale review of the national model. Now they were all focusing on the work of implementation. At the same time, they had the risk of losing focus because of the emphasis on the curriculum and other aspects of the educational system.", "relevant_text_span": [["82", "102"]]}, {"query": "When would the work of implementation be completed?", "answer": "Now the group was engaging with Steve and other officials on agreeing a plan, but also, that plan was there to support the successful implementation of the curriculum. Based on the words from Kirsty, they were very clear about the roles and responsibilities in the middle tier in this phrase following the publication. Now they had moved into a relentless focus on implementation. Basically, everything now was an emphasis on successful implementation.", "relevant_text_span": [["88", "89"]]}, {"query": "What should be expected from reviewing the role of the middle tier?", "answer": "Steve believed that it was set up to build collective efficacy because what people out there were seeing was a confusion of roles in what the regions were doing, and it was building that collective efficacy so everyone was behind the wheel. They would have collective effort, but they needed to do more within the middle tier.", "relevant_text_span": [["90", "95"]]}, {"query": "What's their opinion about the risk of losing focus?", "answer": "In Kirsty's opinion, it appeared that it was placing a focus on the curriculum and other aspects of the educational system. However, there was not a risk from them to lose focus. Absolutely, it was about making sure that there was no duplication, that people were not second-guessing each other's work. There were clear demarcations about who does what in the system. Therefore, there was not a question of losing focus.", "relevant_text_span": [["100", "102"]]}, {"query": "Summarize the discussion about the long-term trends with regard to raising standards and improving educational attainment.", "answer": "According to Kirsty, they were trying to develop a broader range of data and statistics that gave them a whole picture of the education performance, rather than narrowing down on one simple indicator that told only one aspect. They would use the Program for International Student Assessment, and any other external assessments that came through organizations like OECD. In addition, they believed that all the challenges and changes involved were made for the right reasons.

The data was still available, but it was a challenge to them about how to use the data. Sometimes, how they presented data in the past was lulling some people into a false sense of security about the performance of the system. Therefore, it was about how they used the data.

They were not in the business of trying to hide the data because it was absolutely in full transparency. It was about how the data was used rather than about hiding data or making that data not available.

Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Janet Finch-Saunders, and also from Dawn Bowden, and I'd like to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies, who is substituting for Dawn Bowden. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. We'll move on, then, to our evidence session for our inquiry on school improvement and raising standards. I'd like to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Steve Davies, director of education. Thank you both for attending and for your detailed paper in advance of the meeting. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so we'll go straight into questions, if that's okay. If I can just start by asking you: to what extent is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development still involved in the Welsh Government's school improvement journey?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "First of all, can I thank the committee for their invitation this morning, and their interest in this particular area?\u00a0As you will be aware, on coming into office, the director and I agreed to ask the OECD to do a rapid review of the state of Welsh education at the beginning of this Assembly term. They did that, and the feedback from that work informed the publication and content of the national mission. I was very clear in the national mission\u00a0that I would invite the OECD back to review our progress against that mission, and that has happened in the tail end of last year, and the OECD will publish their latest report on Welsh education next month now, in March. So, the expectation is that the report will be published on 23 March, and my intention is to make a statement to the Chamber on 24 March. The nature of that review is part of our ongoing development of self-evaluation. So, we talk a lot about self-evaluation in the school system. Actually, the continuing relationship with OECD is about self-evaluation of the entirety of the system and Welsh Government. We don't want to accept our own orthodoxy and just be in a bubble where we are constantly listening to ourselves and those people who might want to agree with us or tell us what we want to hear. So, the OECD is our best attempt of having some external verification of where we are. That's a risk for Ministers and for Government, because we want them to give an honest evaluation of where we are, but that's a really important tool for me, to ensure that we're constantly testing ourselves. The nature of that review is that the OECD were able to talk to whoever they felt it was important to talk to, so that included practitioners on the ground, elements of the middle tier, as well as Welsh Government. And I know, Chair\u2014I hope you'll be pleased to hear this\u2014that the reports of this committee have formed parts of their review, looking at how the Senedd itself has contributed to and has held the Government to account. So, as I said, we expect our report to be published towards the end of March."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you, Minister. Can I ask about the powers under the School Standards and Organisation (Wales) Act 2013, to ask you to tell us about the use of those powers either by Welsh Government or by local authorities, and how effective you feel that legislation has been?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. Well, as you'll be aware, local authorities have quite extensive powers of intervention in schools if they feel that is necessary. If I'm honest, I think there's a mixed picture, with some local authorities using those powers not on a regular basis, but obviously demonstrating a willingness to use those powers. There are other local authorities who don't seem to have used them. Since that legislation came into being, there have been a number of reasons, because of course a local authority has to give a reason for using those powers of intervention. They usually focus on standards, but sometimes they focus on a breakdown in governance arrangements, perhaps, or a failure or a breakdown in financial management. So, sometimes the budgetary issues trigger an intervention power. And the types of interventions that have been used have included, in some cases, appointing additional governors to governing bodies, or suspending a school's delegated budget so the local authority takes on, then, financial control of that particular school, or sometimes applying to the Welsh Government to entirely replace a governing body and establish an intervention board. So, if I can give you an example of where that's been used and has been successful, in Flintshire. They applied to Welsh Government for two interim executive boards, in Sir Richard Gwyn Catholic High School and in Ysgol Trefonnen. They applied to us. Those governing bodies were dissolved. The IEBs were put in place and both of those schools, which had been in special measures, moved quite rapidly, actually, out of special measures. Perhaps the most recent example of this is one that the Chair will know very well in her own constituency of Torfaen, in Cwmbran High School, where Torfaen has intervened in that case. The Welsh Government has not used those powers to date. My expectation always is that local authorities should be the first port of call, and I would encourage\u2014and we always encourage\u2014local authorities to take a proactive approach to intervention and to use those powers. But it's my belief that it is they who are best placed initially to do that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you, Minister. Can I ask, then, about the national evaluation and improvement resource and how significant a role that will play in the raising of school standards, and how you feel it's evolved since it was first conceived?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "So, this brings us back to the principle of self-evaluation and something, if we're honest, we've not been very good at. If you look at a number of chief inspectors' reports into the Welsh education system, self-evaluation has always been identified as something that is missing or underdeveloped in our system to date, hence, then, the work to establish not a new approach, but a more robust approach to self-evaluation. We've done that in conjunction, again, with the OECD, middle tier and practitioners. It's really important, throughout the entirety of our reform journey that that's done in co-construction, because we want this resource to be usable in schools. So, it's all very well having a conceptual idea and people outside the classroom working on it, but if it's of no practical use to a school leadership team, then we won't see the impact. So, it's\u2014. We're in phase 2 at the moment, where we're doing\u2014. So, the initial resource has been developed by the OECD, middle tier and practitioners. We're in the testing phase at the moment and having it evaluated itself, with a view to introducing that resource across the system at the start of the new academic year, in September 2020. I truly believe that, if we're to make progress in Welsh education, we have to develop the skills within our system to have robust self-evaluation. This resource gives us continuity of approach right the way across Wales. So, it's not left to an individual school to come up with a system; it's right the way across the system. My hope would be that those principles could then be applied to local education authorities, to regional school improvement services and Welsh Government as part of a whole-system approach to self-evaluation. I don't know if there's anything more you want to add, Steve."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "Just to add that the other critical partners are Estyn themselves."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Oh, yes, sorry."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "So, they have played a critical role and, as we know, as the Minister has said in the past, she may introduce policy and practice, but if Estyn are part of it then schools, usually, because they recognise that it will be part of the inspection process\u2014it gives it greater push and support around it. So, they've been key players within it."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And I think, if I just say as well, that the external perception of what that's about is really important. It's not a test of school readiness for reform, it is a genuine attempt for a school to evaluate their strengths, their weaknesses and where they need to go next. It's not an Estyn checklist. And because of the word 'toolkit'\u2014the feedback was that it gave the impression of a checklist, 'Just do this and check list'. So, we're actually going to change the name of that resource. So, it'll be called the national evaluation and improvement resource, rather than the toolkit, because, as I said, the feedback was that 'toolkit' gave the impression of a checklist exercise, and it's got to be about more than that if it's going to be meaningful. So, it'll be changed to an 'improvement resource'."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay.\u00a0Before I bring Suzy in, can I just welcome Si\u00e2n Gwenllian, who is joining us via video-conference in north Wales? Morning, Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Good morning. Can you hear me?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "We can, yes. We can hear you very nicely, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Suzy, you've got a supplementary."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes. Only a very quick one. It's about the development of the\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "The resource."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, the resource, thank you\u2014about whether there were any conflicting ideas in the process of development that made it quite difficult to zone in on something that school leadership teams, in particular, could rely on. Were there differences of opinion on what this should look like?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Not that I'm aware of from the practitioners that I've spoken to who have been part of that. So, for instance, Suzy, you will know the very small school of Gladestry. The head of Gladestry has been involved in this process, and she said that she'd really enjoyed the process of working alongside Estyn and the OECD as a school leader to be able to shape it. But I'm not aware that there's been conflict in that process."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I'm not suggesting that there has been; I'm just interested as to how it had worked, that's all."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "Chair, I think, inevitably, when you bring stakeholders together, they're not going to be in total agreement as to how it's going to work, and I think initially one of the challenges was having Estyn there as part of the facilitation group. There are always some concerns that, actually, it's coming from a to inspect, oral, judgmental tick box. So, we had some early day challenges where we had to convince\u2014and, ultimately, Estyn convinced them\u2014that they were there to help and support as opposed to to inspect, and that the model that was developed, as the Minister said, was not going to be a tick box, 'You are good at this part of self-evaluation', it was to build the skillsets up."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. So, it's got their full confidence."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, and I think again, also, what\u2014. You know, four years into the job, what I've reflected on as well is there is this sometimes a feeling out there that the Minister says all the right stuff, but you're not actually going to do it, so, when you talk about a new approach to doing things, you're not actually serious about it. So, trying to build that confidence that we are serious about developing a new system around self-improvement, which is different from accountability\u2014sometimes, the practitioners are like, 'Oh, yes, we've heard it all before but it never actually happens.' And I think that's been a part of the constant\u2014not pressure, but the responsibility on Welsh Government is in following through. So, we said that we were going to do this in the national mission, and we are going to do it. I'm really proud that there or thereabouts, a few months either way, we've actually kept to the timetable as outlined in the national mission, and that helps build confidence within the sector that we are committed to that programme and we're going to do what we say we're going to do."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "And a final question from me: how effective do you think the investment in school standards has been in this Assembly term, as opposed to the approach taken in the last Assembly term, where there was the protection put in place for core school budgets?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I think, first of all, it's important that, whilst this additional resource is specifically targeted at school standards, that is only a part of a much wider education budget, a budget that\u2014you know\u2014is incredibly complex. And so it is really challenging to be able to draw straight lines\u2014you know, 'We did this and it's resulted in that'\u2014given that we're looking at the entirety of school funding here. What's been really important is that, if you drill down into what that money has been spent on, 50 per cent of it has been directed towards professional learning in one form or another to support our teaching professionals. And that's been really important to me. I've said it time and time again: an education system cannot exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out to work with them and teach them. Therefore, that investment in staff and investment in the professional learning of our staff and support for them I think is making a difference already but, importantly, will continue to make a difference. But I think it is really challenging to be able to say, 'Well, we spent this bit of money and it definitely led to that', because it's such a complex picture. But that money, the way it's been spent, has been driven by evidence. And, again, what we do know from international best practice, what do we know that works in driving up standards, and then how can we align the money that we've got to supporting that? And, as I said, 50 per cent of that money has gone directly to simply supporting the professional learning of those who work with our children."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you very much. We're going to talk now a bit about schools causing concern with questions from Huw Irranca-Davies."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. If I can, just first of all, zoom in on the way in which we actually decide which schools need what support. So, one of the interesting questions for us is how do we use the different systems out there. So, we've got the school categorisation system, which we're familiar with. We've also got Estyn inspection reports, then we've got other intelligence, including local intelligence on the ground. How do you decide from that? How is it decided what schools need support, need challenge? How do we do that?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, you're right: what we have is a variety of ways in which we can identify schools that need support, or need to be challenged on their practice. But it's important not to confuse them either. So, our primary route to doing this is our school categorisation system. Sometimes, and perhaps this is inevitable\u2014. That system is primarily there as a triage system around identifying where our resource should be spent. So, our school improvement service\u2014it's a risk-based approach, so they can evaluate where they need to put their time, effort and resource. Sometimes, it's used by other people for other things, but that is not its primary purpose; its primary purpose there is not one of accountability, it is one of identifying risk and aligning that then to the support that is available. Estyn\u2014now that is part of that accountability system. That is our method of holding schools and their governing bodies to account for their practice and for the work that they do. Both systems, of course, are evolving. So, how we do categorisation has changed over a period of time. The elements that go into making that judgment around the levels of support have changed, and, of course, the Estyn inspection regime is also changing. At the moment, schools are only inspected once every seven years. We're moving to a system where Estyn will be more regularly in schools. So, they are two systems, but they are different and they look at different things. But our categorisation system is how we look for those ways of identifying support for schools."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "And you've made, with feedback over the last few years, adjustments to the way that the categorisation system works. Are you content with where it is now, or do you see more adjustments being made? Have you got things in front of you that you're getting feedback on saying 'Well, we need to tweak this again a little bit'?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "So, that system has evolved over time. So, when it started, it was just a tool around secondary schools. Now, it covers the breadth of schools. Initially, on coming into office, when I first came in, it was purely driven by data, and it was also done in quartiles. So, there was a certain number of schools that had to be in the bottom, which drove practitioners mad. They were like 'Ah, every year, there's going to be some of us that have to be in the bottom quartile', because of the way in which it was arranged, which seemed very unfair to them. So, we've changed that. It's not just purely driven on data now; there are other judgments\u2014the professional judgments of our challenge advisers are taken into account. And I would expect that situation to continue to evolve to align itself to our curriculum reform, and our changes in self-evaluation. So, it's not a fixed point. I expect that that system will continue to evolve and change, so that it complements and assists in the reform journey as other parts of the system change."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Thanks for that. I think, for any impartial reader of the way that the trends have been going on this, there is some good news within that, in that, certainly, those schools that might have been identified as have been okay but coasting along, seem to be moving up the categories, although we still do have that\u2014. Well, it's what the system is there to do, it's to identify those schools that do need that additional support. And I like your analogy of a triage system\u2014'You're fit; keep on doing what you're doing and do it well; you need more support, we'll put the support in.' But, can I turn to those schools that are causing significant concern, and how we identify them? The Estyn chief inspector's conclusions at the end of the 2017-18 report that these schools are not being identified early enough\u2014there's a need to do something urgently about these concerns, particularly in secondary schools. Have we addressed that? Are you content that we've addressed that concern? Was he right?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No, the chief inspector is absolutely right\u2014absolutely right. I've got no beef with that statement at all. In some ways, when a school goes into special measures, in a way, that's a failure of the system, because that should have been identified sooner. So I've got no beef, as I said, with the chief inspector saying that."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "So just to ask, bearing in mind the earlier discussion we were having, how is it that we don't identify those schools?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "That's it\u2014you're quite right. Undoubtedly, what categorisation has done is led to a greater understanding, I think, on behalf of local education authorities' and school improvement services' knowledge about their schools. I think knowledge around schools is greatly enhanced by that process. But we are not there yet in terms of necessarily, then, moving those schools more quickly, once they've been identified as needing the highest level of support to see improvement. And secondary schools is a particular, particular challenge. So you will have seen from the last publication of categorisation data that our primary sector continues to improve\u2014more and more and more of our primary schools are in a green rating, which is very satisfying to me. But we have got more of an issue with secondary schools, and we have a particular issue with the same schools being identified in that level of categorisation. So even though we've identified them as needing that extra help, they are not moving at pace away from that system. So there are two things that we are doing at the moment. The first is, we are, again, looking at different sets of data that can give us even earlier warning systems that things are going wrong in a school\u2014and perhaps Steve will explain later. For instance, staff sickness, and carefully monitoring staff sickness, because there is a direct correlation between high levels of staff sickness in a school and what is going on in the school. And Steve can explain some of this work later. But we're piloting a new approach to those schools that are causing concern. Each local authority has been asked to identify two of their high schools that they are particularly worried about. And we have a new multi-agency approach, working with those schools to try and move them more forward. So it's two from each region, a multi-agency panel, working with the school. And that multi-agency panel includes the school itself, the local authority, the regional consortia school improvement staff, Estyn and Welsh Government\u2014as a multi-agency panel to support improvement in that school. So, for instance, what would normally happen, Estyn would come in, Estyn would make a judgment on the school\u2014requiring special measures or urgent improvement\u2014and Estyn would go away. They'd go away for six months, and then they'd come back in six months, and they'd make another judgment, 'No, still not good enough', and disappear for six months. We're saying\u2014Estyn and the Welsh Government have agreed that's not the best approach; Estyn need to be part of the solution, rather than just coming and making a judgment. The initial feedback from this trial is very, very positive. Actually, we've had local authorities coming to us and saying, 'Can we put more schools in? Rather than just having two of our high schools, can we engage more in this project and this pilot?' It's being evaluated by Cardiff Metropolitan University and Swansea University, so we're having some academic overview to see, actually, does this approach work, can we evidence it\u2014that it actually makes a difference? And it's actually\u2014I'd like to claim all the credit for it, but it's actually not dissimilar to something that's happening in Scotland as well. But we knew that carrying on doing the same old thing clearly wasn't moving these schools, we needed a new approach, and this is what we're doing at the moment. So it's relatively new, but the initial feedback is positive. Steve, I don't know\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "I think your important point is about, 'What about the schools that are sliding in that direction?' And it's bringing together what we know from Estyn, but also, critically, local authorities have knowledge of their schools, and so do consortia. We've got to be better at bringing those together. So, the Minister gave the example of staff sickness\u2014not always a trigger, but it's one of those. If you look at movement of pupils out of a school, you can look at complaints, you can look at, actually, emerging increased use of HR resources that a school pulls on a local authority. None of these have been pushed up into the public domain, but they're important antennae. The point the Minister made about Estyn as well is, historically, when they go into special measures, Estyn, at the end of that week, call in, historically, either the region or the local authority, they will feed back to one of them, and then they go away. So, they are staying with it. So, we are brining together the knowledge. But, as the Minister said, we want to keep a very clear distinction between the accountability and the transparency to the public, to parents, with the very detailed collective work of that multi-agency group to actually make that difference over time."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Okay. So, does that\u2014. I'd love to go further, but time is against us. Does that deal with the issue of the schools that have been identified in those categories of requiring significant improvement and requiring special measures? Are those the ones that will be identified now, or is that above and beyond that again?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, those are the ones that are primarily at the forefront of our minds, but this way of sharing data better, to step in earlier, is part of our attempt to address what the chief inspector says about stepping in early\u2014not waiting until a school gets into special measures and a formal judgment from Estyn of that, but actually using that intelligence to get support in there earlier. The three elements that that multi-agency approach look at are: what are the fundamentals that need addressing in this school? What is the capacity of the school itself to be able to address those fundamentals? And, what extra support needs to go into that senior management team and the governing body to get those fundamentals addressed? And actually, what does sustainable improvement look like? Because, again, one of the issues, sometimes, that happens is, a school goes into a category with Estyn, there's a big push and a big, 'We must do something' and the school comes out, but actually, that improvement is not sustainable. It's the low-hanging fruit; it's the easy wins that have been achieved, but actually, perhaps some of the fundamental challenges underlying in that school haven't been addressed in that process. So, this is about what will sustainable improvement look like in six months, what's it going to look like in 12 months and what's it going to look like in 18 months. So, actually, a more strategic, longer term approach to real change in a school rather than, perhaps, some of the easy-to-fix items that make a school as if it's doing better, but we really haven't tackled some of the underlying problems that make that school vulnerable to slipping back. Does that make sense?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "I've got a couple of supplementaries on\u2014. Sorry?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Does that make sense?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Yes. We've got a couple of supplementaries on this, first from Suzy and then from Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you for that, Chair. Obviously, I'm pleased to hear that this work is being done, but I'm wondering\u2014. What strikes me, in the recent past, at least, particularly as we've got the usual suspects in this category\u2014. I've got to ask myself why it is that councils have been reluctant, perhaps, to step in with these schools earlier, particularly as they've got consortia or middle-tier support as well. Has there been a deficit in that space that has meant that councils don't feel equipped to step in? I just don't really get it why they've been reluctant to step in so far. If they've been nervous about doing it, because they don't feel that they've got the tools to do it, then I think that's pretty important, because as you were saying, we were talking about fundamentals; surely, councils have been able to deal with fundamentals, and more importantly, consortia up until now. Because, obviously, we're asking these players to give us evidence at some point, so perhaps I'd like to challenge them on how come we're here now."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And rightly so."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I'm not laying this at your door."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And rightly so. I guess each local authority will have an explanation for each individual school, I suspect. What's crucial to me is that we have to\u2014. I see our job as corralling the collective effort, and I think, for too long in the system, there has been a lack of co-ordination. So, this is about bringing and corralling a collective effort to address this, going forward, in more sustainable way. And I think it does come back to this issue around self-evaluation and a willingness to be open, honest and upfront about some of the challenges that we've got. It's not easy, is it? It's not easy to accept or to acknowledge sometimes when things are\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "That they don't know how to do this."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, that they're going badly, or perhaps they don't know exactly how to make the difference. So this approach, as I said, is a new way of trying to coral that collective effort across the board. But, I don't know if Steve\u2014because you've done other roles in the system, so perhaps you've got a different insight."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "I think you're right. The variation across the country, across local authorities\u2014. There are some local authorities that we've worked with and we identify have taken the appropriate action. There are others that we're working with, and yes, at its best, it's done as a joint exercise where they use their regional school improvement service to help in the identification that there is a need for this.\u00a0They take advice as to what the action is, whether it is, as the Minister said, in the more significant areas, a board, or whether a warning notice comes in terms of standards or finance. So, we're working with them and we're working with the Welsh Local Government Association to share that practice. An example of that work is: we have done a development training session for cabinet members for education, and scrutiny leads for education across Wales, and all 22 local authorities came to that and engaged with that. That was partly about self-improvement, but it was also about where significant issues arise, you have to constructively confront them. And that comes with what the region knows, and increasingly, we're looking to have it consistently across 22 local authorities, so they are collecting all the additional data that we referred to earlier, so they can legitimately hold a mirror up and say, 'This is a real concern that we have. We're not punishing you, but we're registering the seriousness, and we want you to address it.' And we're making progress. I believe it's genuinely more consistent now, but I'd be lying if I said that there was consistency across all 22 local authorities."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you. I'm conscious of time."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. I've got a supplementary from Si\u00e2n, then back to Huw."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Because you are moving to a more sophisticated approach in terms of identifying problems sooner, and so can offer the support earlier, is it time to think about moving away from the system of categorisation entirely? That is, has the categorisation system reached the end of its usefulness, and is the multi-agency approach, this more sophisticated approach, a better way, ultimately, of being able to assist schools in moving forward?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think, Si\u00e2n, as I said earlier, the categorisation system has evolved over time, and my expectation is that it will continue to evolve, because it has to be consistent with our overall approach to school improvement and raising standards. I expect OECD will have feedback for us on this important part of our system, and we'll wait to see exactly what they say about it, but as I said in answer to Huw Irranca-Davies earlier, I haven't got a closed mind; we've demonstrated over the last four years our willingness to change the system to make it a smarter system, and we will continue to keep that under review, as we move forward. If I could just go back briefly, it doesn't sound like a very exciting thing, does it, when we say we've been doing work with the WLGA, with cabinet members, but also scrutiny, because that's a really important part of the jigsaw as well, is actually local government scrutiny of the performance of your education portfolio holder and the leadership of your council. So this is about trying to up the ante on all sides, so that those issues around 'What are you doing in your local authority to use the powers that you have?' You know, sometimes, making sure that everybody in that authority\u2014those in power and those who are there to hold those in power to account\u2014have the necessary skills, knowledge and understanding to do that appropriately."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Huw, briefly."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Yes, briefly. I only have one final question. We've talked a lot about early identification; getting in there and then managing the improvement, this triage approach there, and then getting some grip of it, as well, in doing all of that. But my question now is on what we currently have. I won't touch on the primary schools, but let's just look at secondary schools\u201411 per cent of secondary schools inspected in the last two academic years judged as unsatisfactory, needing urgent improvement. There will always be secondary schools and primary schools that hit moments of crisis for one reason or another, but 11 per cent to me, and to any layperson, would seem unreasonably high. Are you\u2014? It would be daft to ask you if you're content. What is a level that you would be content with of having schools in red category in Wales?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "You're right. Schools will need different levels of support at different points, and sometimes, it's not because of a crisis. So, for instance, in my region, we do have an increase in the number of schools in the amber category. That's because we've seen in that particular region a number of headteachers retire because they've reached retirement age, and there are new headteachers. Well, that is a moment of risk in the school\u2014when senior leadership changes. Nothing else has changed in that school, but the simple fact that you have a new leader, sometimes in those cases it might be their first headship. That means that that school is going to need a little bit of extra support, so it isn't always just a crisis that needs extra support, there are just general things that happen in the life of a school that could lead to it. But you're absolutely right\u2014we have a particular challenge in the secondary sector where we have not been able to move individual schools forward at pace. And 11 per cent is not acceptable to me, Huw, which is why we have introduced this new pilot to address those schools where, persistently, we have concerns about their ability to move forward. If we'd have carried on doing the same thing, I suspect we would have just carried on getting the same result\u2014hence the need for a new approach to those schools that are causing concern."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "Very briefly, the things we talked about earlier was how we measure the performance of schools, particularly at GCSEs, with a narrow focus. As was said earlier, some of these are the same groups\u2014they trip in and then they don't come out. Our belief is, from research, that they concentrate on squeezing the pips to get the grades up in some small areas for a period of time, and you can do that by targeting and immersing them. Estyn can tick the box to say your grades have got better, but we haven't handled the serious underpinning issues\u2014leadership, teaching and learning, and bringing those together. As the Minister said, what does sustainable improvement look like in six, 12, 18 months? It isn't just, as important as they are, getting those exam grades up a bit. They're the fundamental\u2014. And if they're all agreed as the indicators at the outset, we're more likely\u2014. So it's multi-agency; it's not a little activity, it's a major strategy."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Hefin David has some questions now on the middle tier."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I'd like to consider the work of the consortia. In 2016, your election manifesto very clearly said that you wanted to abolish regional consortia\u2014three words in it. Why haven't you done it?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Because, given that you're such a keen student of my manifesto, you'll also know that\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "It was only three words."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "The Liberal Democrat manifesto also said that we supported major local government reform and a major reduction in the number of local government units. That hasn't happened. I have to say genuinely, my experience over the last four years has proven to me the value of regional working, and in the absence of significant local government reform, I think it's absolutely vital that we have scale in school improvement services\u2014scale that I don't think can be delivered across 22 individual local authorities."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. So, if there was local government reform, you would abolish the consortia."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think if there was significant local government reform and we could demonstrate that those units had such a scale that they could perform the functions of regional consortia, then I think it would be inevitable that any education Minister would look to see whether there was an opportunity to change structures. But in the absence of that, Hefin, I have been absolutely convinced whilst doing this job that you need larger units to be able to carry out successful school improvement work, and I think it would be reckless to advocate the system going back to school improvement being organised in 22 different ways."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. Do you think that the work of the four consortia has been consistent and effective?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "The school improvement services?"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "The four consortia."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think, as with individual local education authorities, there are some regional consortia services that have performed really highly\u2014and that's not me saying that, that's Estyn, but gives us assurance around that\u2014and there are others that need to improve. I think the consortia themselves would admit that they, since their establishment, have found new ways of working. Initially, they were very separate entities that did things their own way. Increasingly, over recent years, we have seen those consortia working together on a national approach, but delivered on a regional basis. So I think they themselves have evolved over time. But we are constantly looking for optimum delivery from those particular organisations, but as I said, I think it would be absolutely reckless to go back to a situation where school improvement services were being delivered individually on 22 different bases."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. I'm happy to accept that you've changed your opinion there; that's no problem at all. But with regard to the four consortia, and we'll take Education through Regional Working as an example, it does things differently to the other three. Is that a cause for concern, or do you think that's entirely appropriate?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, ERW does things differently, but then so does the Education Achievement Service. EAS is constituted in a different way to the Central South Consortium. What I'm interested in is not necessarily how they are constituted and organised, I'm interested in the effectiveness of that organisation to deliver for children and for teachers. ERW has got particular challenges, and we continue to work with those in ERW to address those, but increasingly, as I said, what we are seeing the regional consortia do is develop a national approach to school improvement services but deliver that on a regional basis so that there is greater consistency in terms of delivery."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Are you happy that, within the ERW area, local authorities employ their own improvement advisers, rather than doing it in the way that the others do?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We have discussed this at length with them. My preference would be for school improvement officers to be employed in the centre, and we continue to have those discussions, but what's really important to understand is that the regional consortia are not a beast of the Government; they are a beast of the local authorities that have worked together to create a school improvement service that meets their needs. So we can't impose that solution, and we continue to discuss with ERW what is the optimal way, and they continue to discuss with their constituent local authorities about how that should be organised."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Are you concerned that Neath Port Talbot have given notice that they want to withdraw from regional working?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think it's really disappointing that Neath Port Talbot have published that notice. What's important for me is to understand\u2014not for me, it will be important for Estyn. It will be really important for us to understand how Neath Port Talbot intend to support their schools and their teachers if they were to withdraw from ERW, especially at what is a very, very critical time. The regional consortia have a key role to play in supporting systems with the introduction of the curriculum. I would want to know from Neath Port Talbot how they are going to do that without being part of that organisation. And, of course, there's the added complexity that so much of our money is channelled through to schools via the regional consortia. So, I would want to understand from Neath Port Talbot how they're going to safeguard their schools and make sure that the children who are receiving their education in Neath Port Talbot are not disadvantaged if they were to follow through on that decision."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Do you feel that it's your role to intervene in that area and instruct Neath Port Talbot and ERW as to how they should resolve this issue?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, as I said, I would be seeking assurances\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "What does that mean, though, 'seeking assurances'?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, Neath Port Talbot would need to demonstrate to me how they're going to address these issues. If they're not part of ERW and their schools and their children are not going to be in receipt of the support from ERW, as I said, especially at this critical time, how are they intending to do that? I haven't seen those plans, but if they were to push forward and follow through on the notice, I would want to see them and I suspect Estyn would want to see them also."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay, just last issue on that: you're just waiting to see what Neath Port Talbot do next, then."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, we have written to Neath Port Talbot to ask them to demonstrate to us, if they were to pull out of ERW, how they're going to meet their functions. I have not heard back from them."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Steve, did you want to say something?"}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "Obviously\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014that point. We wrote to them last Friday, and we are awaiting their response now."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. So, that's where we are. Okay. There was the document in 2015\u2014'National model for regional working'. Is that the current document? Are there plans to change or update it, or is that exactly where we stand?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "So, that is the current model. Some work was undertaken in 2017 and 2018 to look to update that model and revise that model. Some specific recommendations were put forward about additional services that could be organised on a regional basis; primarily, that is a specialist human resources resource. We know that, because of austerity in some local authorities, HR departments have been really stretched. Education HR is a specialist service, it's not generic. It's often a service that\u2014. I see that as part of a school improvement service. Support for governors also has been stretched within individual local authorities. So, a proposal was put forward to include specialist HR and governor support as part of the regional model. That was rejected by local government. Our local authorities did not want to include that in the regional model. However, I must say, having presented that evidence, some of our local authorities, even though there wasn't a national agreement to put that into the national model, have pooled their resources, and those services are being delivered and supported on a regional basis. So, for instance, the Education Achievement Service now provide specialist HR resource, and EAS and Central South provide governor support. So, although we weren't successful in persuading local government to adopt a new national model, local authorities in those areas saw the value of moving that way."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, with that in mind, and perhaps I'll put this to Steve Davies, everything the Minister just said, and also the line in the document\u2014 'The implementation of this model will change over time'\u2014 is it time to go back to that document and review it from a procedural point of view?"}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "I don't think it's necessarily timely to go back and have a complete review of it. But, certainly, we are in ongoing discussions with the Welsh Local Government Association, both in terms of work with local authorities, and the type of intervention in schools. So, we keep a constant watch as to which areas that we believe we could develop further. We are not currently intending to do a wholesale review of that. As the Minister touched on earlier, there is some work to get consistency across the current area, particularly, as we just mentioned, in relation to ERW work. So, it's getting a consistent approach at that level, and sharing the practice. I think what is emerging, as the Minister said, is that there are two regions who have already made this shift to pool services. I think the two other regions are seeing and will see the benefits of that, and instead of forcing it through, we'd expect that to evolve. But we're not, at this stage, looking to a wholesale review of the national model."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Hefin."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And Professor Dylan Jones's strategic delivery group seems to have had quite a warm welcome in the sector. Is it fair to say that?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I believe so. I'm very grateful to Dylan for his hard work and his skill in chairing that group, and I think it's been welcomed by all, so that we can get that clarity and consistency about the roles and responsibilities of the individual partners and players in the middle tier."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And when will the work be completed, and what will the outcomes be?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, the group is currently engaging with Steve and other officials on agreeing a plan, but also, crucially, that plan is there to support the successful implementation of the curriculum, so that we're very clear about the roles and responsibilities in the middle tier in this crucial phase following the publication. We have to move now from the publication into a relentless focus on implementation. The history of devolution is full of fantastic documents, and, shall I say, patchy implementation.\u00a0The work that has gone into that curriculum is too important for implementation to be left to chance. It's too important. It's too good to be left to chance. So, everything now is a relentless focus on successful implementation."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Yes, but I'm thinking that the strategic delivery is reviewing the role of the middle tier. So, you know, what do we expect to see from it, notwithstanding the kind of softly, softly approach that you've already talked about?"}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "It was set up, actually, about 18 months ago\u2014just under. It was set up to build collective\u00a0efficacy, because what people out there are seeing is that there's a confusion of roles, in what the regions are doing, and it was building that collective efficacy so everyone was behind the wheel. So, they've been looking at who is doing what for the last 18 months, and exploring and making some changes themselves. It's not just what they do with Government or what they do with each other; it's just happened that it's timely, because one of the key bits of feedback we believe we will get from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is we have had co-construction, we'd had collective effort, but we need to do more, particularly within the middle tier. This is not controlled by Government, it is arm's length from Government, and it's not their job to get it ready for the new curriculum\u2014that's a key part of it. This group will have an ongoing role; it's not a task and finish group. It does feed back in to the Minister but there's no formal mechanism by which they have to report."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay, that's very clear."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay.

What I'm about to say, I say it even though I'm a big localist: it all seems to be heading in one direction of a national service. Is the strategic group even thinking in these terms, obviously building in local accountability? But it'll just make it so much easier in terms of accountability and consistency to monitor what the middle tier does, if it's a national service, like the National Adoption Service.

As Steve just said, I receive feedback from Dylan, because I meet Dylan in this particular capacity on a planned basis. He is there to give me advice on the middle tier, and to give me advice on what he thinks Welsh Government needs to do.

Well, thank you for that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "What I was going to raise has been answered already, that is that, from what I can see, the work that Professor Dylan Jones is doing has evolved somewhat. I felt that, originally, the idea was to look at the middle tier in terms of any kind of duplication that was happening, and where it was possible to tighten up the people going into schools from different directions. But it appears that it has evolved to be something that's much more than that, and that it is placing a focus on the curriculum and other aspects of the educational system. Is there a risk for them to lose focus in that sense?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No, not at all. I think they are very, very clear around establishing roles and responsibilities for each of the players and to be very clear about the expectations that each part of the middle tier can have of each other, as to what they can expect from their partners in the middle tier. And absolutely, it is about making sure that there isn't duplication, that people aren't second-guessing each other's work, and there are clear demarcations about who does what in the system, and, as I said, knowing that you can rely on your colleague in the middle tier to do the bit that they are responsible for. So, I don't think there's a question of it losing focus."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We've got a lot of areas to cover so we are going to have to pick up our pace a bit. The next questions are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Thinking about you as a Minister trying to see what the long-term trends are with regard to raising standards and improving educational attainment, is that difficult, because the performance measures have changed, haven't they? We can't compare like-for-like now, because of the changes that have been made in the way that performance is measured. So, to begin with, is that a challenge, to see whether progress has been made? And secondly, what evidence do you as Minister use to look at the long-term trends?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "The first thing to say, with regard to changes to performance measures\u2014you're right that change to those does make it, in some cases, more difficult to look at trends over a period of time. But those changes are made for really good reasons. If we change a performance measure, it is done to ensure that it is in the best interests of learners. And I think the best interests of learners always trumps the ease of comparison. I understand that, for researchers and for opposition Members, even for Ministers, it would be simpler to have the same set of measures over a period of time. But if we know that those things are driving behaviours that are unhelpful to children, and not in the best interests of children, then we have to change them, even thought that then does create challenges in different areas. With regard to what do we look at, there are a number of ways that we gain data and look at data in the system: everything from the categorisation system we spoke of earlier, and trends in categorisation; we look at Estyn reports; we continue to look at examination results. But we're trying to develop a broader range of data and statistics that give us a whole picture of the education performance, rather than narrowing down on one simple indicator that tells you one thing but doesn't tell you everything. But I don't know, Steve, if there's anything further that you'd like to add."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "It's going back to what the Member raised earlier, in terms of the range of things that you look at\u2014things that can make a difference. So, when Estyn review schools, or we're looking to develop national frameworks for things like mental health and well-being, which look to the practice that enables raising standards, it's collecting that information, both at a national level, through the annual review of Estyn, as well as our engagement with regions and local authorities. So, it's looking at the evidence base that goes beyond, but impacts on data. And, inevitably, we will use the Programme for International Student Assessment, and any other external assessments that come through organisations like the OECD. And even where we've changed the performance measures, we still have, at national level, the ongoing data. So, if you looked at level 2 plus, we believe it is important that children get five good GCSEs\u2014for higher education and for employment. So, we've not lost sight of those at a national level\u2014we're not using them as a narrow set of performance measures for individual schools."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "So, if we look at\u2014level 2 plus is a good example. We know that a relentless focus on that single measure, as a way of judging the system, leads to a set of behaviours in schools. It narrows the focus onto a certain part of the cohort, it narrows the curriculum, when we know that children\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "I'm not challenging the fact that you've changed the performance measures\u2014I understand that, and having a broader way of looking is better in the long run. I'm just saying, because there's been this change, it makes it more of a challenge\u2014whilst accepting why you've made the changes, but it does present more of a challenge, presumably, because you have to look at more indicators, and take evidence from different places. But I take it that you're confident that the trajectory is going in the right way."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, I think we are making improvements. But you're right: it does make it more challenging. But those changes are being made for the right reasons, as I said, whether that be at level 2 plus. Look at English literature. I understand why perhaps a performance measure around English was introduced, but the effect of that was that significant numbers of children\u2014and, it must be said, usually children who are entitled to free school meals\u2014were suddenly not sitting English literature GCSE. We've changed that performance measure, and guess what? Last year, we saw a significant increase in the number of children that were sitting English literature GCSE. For standards of literacy and oracy, I think studying literature is really, really important, before we even get into the joy of introducing children to the written word and the love of reading. So, we make changes. Yes, it causes challenges, but we're making those changes because we believe that they are in the best interest of children, and that has to trump ease of comparison."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Why have you decided to ask the consortia, Estyn and so on not to report on local data or regional level data? How do we then come to conclusions about what is working if it isn't presented on a local authority and regional basis?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I think the thing to say about the communications from\u00a0Welsh Government, Estyn, and the WLGA is it's not about not communicating the data, it's about challenging people on how that data should be used. So, the data is still available, but it's a challenge to them about how to use that data. So, for instance, when we're presenting data that compares local authority to local authority, you could have a local authority that says, 'There we go, I'm above the national average. I don't need to worry about the education in my local authority, because I'm above the average, or I'm better than my neighbour.' That doesn't necessarily mean that everything is right in your local education authority. Perhaps your children should be doing even better than what you're presented with. So, actually, it's not about hiding data; it's about how you use the data appropriately. And sometimes, how we were presenting data in the past was lulling some people into a false sense of security about the performance of their system. So, it's about how you use data, and that's what the communication from Welsh Government and the WLGA and Estyn was about: think very carefully about this data and what it's telling you about your system, and don't be lulled into a false sense of security that you may be doing brilliantly. Or, perhaps, looking at your data, you may think, 'Oh, my goodness me, we're not doing very well at all', but, actually, more careful consideration of that might show that your school's impact on those children is really, really a positive one. So, you've got to use that data in the context. So, it's not about less data. If anything, it's about more data and, crucially for me, it's about more intelligent use and interrogation of that data, about truly what it's telling you about your system."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "But again, the Welsh Government\u2014. You have continued to publish the local and regional level data. So, doesn't that contradict what you've been telling the consortia and everyone else?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No, not at all. As I said, we're not in the business of trying to hide data\u2014I believe absolutely in full transparency. And in terms of level 2 data, I think I'm not moving away from the point that I think it's really important that more and more children get five really good GCSEs. I think it's important for their life chances. It is about how that data is used, not about hiding data or making that data not available."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "Can I, very briefly\u2014? We didn't just send a letter out collectively. We've now carried out training jointly with WLGA and Estyn on how to use that data. So, it's not just looking where your LA is; it's also not looking at whether your school's better than average for the authority. And it is well received, and it should broaden the approach of scrutiny committees to beyond what historically was, if I'm honest, looking at the league table for their authority or looking at the league table of local authorities. It's not that they shouldn't be looking at that, but they need to dig much, much deeper underneath it."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. We're going to go on now to Suzy. I'm going to appeal for brief questions and brief answers so that we can cover the rest of the questions."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I'll shorten these questions, okay. We know why you got rid of the old measures. We've got interim measures now. What are they telling you about the success you've had in trying to avoid the bad behaviour?\u00a0Short answers."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "It's impossible. [Laughter.] I think it's inevitable: whatever kind of measures we put in place, people will look to maximise their success in those measures, and I don't think we'll ever come up with a system where those measures are absolutely perfect. What's really important to me is that we're really, really, really challenging schools to look at the performance of all of their children, rather than just at a very, very narrow cohort around those C/D boundaries, which we knew was detrimental, potentially, to more able and talented children and really pushing those Bs to As and those As to A*s, and children for whom actually just getting in to school on a daily basis is an achievement, and the school has done well to provide that. So, our new capped 9 makes sure that there is breadth across a range of subjects, rather than just focusing on a narrower and narrower bunch of subject opportunities for children, and our new third-third-third system enables schools to really look at their performance. So if their capped 9 score is high, what's driving that? Is it because the bottom third of the cohort is doing really well, and the impact on those children is above and beyond what could be expected, but actually, you're not doing very well for your more able and talented; you're not pushing them on? Alternatively, maybe your capped 9 score is because your MAT children are doing incredibly well, but actually, you're not really making the progress for the middle tier of those children. It allows us to have a greater focus on the performance of our FSM children\u2014where they really are within that system. So, it's a much more granular\u2014. And crucially for me, it looks at the impact for every child, because every child has to matter in the system, and what we had before was a narrowing of curriculum choice and a narrowing on a certain cohort of children."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "So are the permanent measures likely to be pretty similar to what you've got now? Because the research\u2014I don't know if the research is complete yet. When will you be publishing the new permanent evaluation?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Sue, you're right: they're interim measures at the moment, and we will need to make sure that the performance measures are aligned to the new curriculum. That, potentially, of course\u2014. Because Wales's review of qualifications potentially has an impact on what those finally will look like, so that work is ongoing at the moment, and unless Steve can tell me off the top of his head when we expect that to be completed by, I will send you a note. But they're interim at the moment, because we need to align them to the new curriculum."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I think we understand that.\u00a0[Inaudible.]\u2014date."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "No, no. This is not a quick fix. This is a two to three-year research base. The new qualifications for the new curriculum will not start until 2025. They have to be in place for 2022. There's a three-year roll on. I would expect the broad structure of the interim measures to continue over that time. There will be some tweaks for consistency. It's what's wrapped around those interim measures that I touched on earlier: the other evidence that we bring to bear about the effectiveness of a school, but we do want to say to schools that on the whole, broadly speaking, the interim measures will carry on for two, three years."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, and the reason I asked that is right at the beginning of this session, the Minister said to the Chair that this \u00a3100 million that's going into school improvements will be going into things that work. We need some evidence that the interim measures are going to work as well, so when are they going to be evaluated?"}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "Well, we've only just used them for one year."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "That's what I'm asking you."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "We've signalled that they're only going to be in place for three years. We are carrying out our own review of the impact of those and that's been built in, but I expect the OECD report\u2014because it is an extensive report\u2014to give us feedback on how those things are working now, and some steer, as they did with the last report, as to the direction we would want to go into."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And what I'm also interested in is those performance management measures around schools. Yes, they're about outcomes for children, but actually are about a broader suite of behaviours within that school, so, yes, qualifications and grades are an important part of a performance measure, but actually, I have other expectations of schools, above and beyond simply qualifications. And so, we would want our permanent set of performance measures to look at a wider set of behaviours within a school, and I think because\u2014. Exams are important\u2014of course they are, qualifications are important\u2014but the way in which those schools achieve those results are also important."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Would you anticipate that including well-being, then?"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "In a whole-school approach."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I absolutely\u2014and we need to find a way\u00a0of how we can truly measure that. Sometimes, children's well-being is influenced by lots of things outside the control of a school. So, I don't want schools to be held accountable for things that they have no control over, because of the circumstances in which a child may be living. But, absolutely: well-being and how the culture of the school addresses well-being is really important to me."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Suzy. Move on to PISA, please."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "How useful is PISA for you in helping school improvement? I know that it's not always the thing that you enjoy watching or looking out for. But, genuinely, how useful is it?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "It is one of a range of tools that we need to look at. Si\u00e2n, quite rightly, talked about consistency. PISA is one thing where there is a level of consistency, so it will continue to be, I think, an important part of how we test how our system is doing."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "We know that you are a little bit encouraged, but we are not out of the woods yet. You mentioned this in Plenary when we talked about PISA. How confident are you that we are on track for meeting these targets that were set before your time, or do you think that having those targets is helpful? Is it setting up aspirations that are incapable of being met within a period of time?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, those long-term targets of a score around 500 are part of 'Our National Mission', and we have to keep the pressure on to strive. They are testing, but we have to keep the pressure on to strive to reach them. In some cases, I can be quite encouraged. If we look at reading scores for girls, we are almost there, but that just demonstrates what a journey we've got with our boys to address. For me, one of the ways in which we will reach those targets and achieve them is further progress on our more able and talented children. Although we are now performing at an OECD average, I will be the first person to admit that, although we have seen an improvement in the higher level skills of our more able and talented children, we do not perform at an OECD average with regard to those level 6 and level 5 scores."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Even within the UK, really, we are quite far behind."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes. So, I think that's where we really need to push on. That's one of the reasons why we have introduced a more able and talented budget to support that, and our Seren programme, which is delivering fantastic results post-16. That's why we're introducing the principles of Seren earlier into children's careers, bringing it down from year 9 upwards, to be able to drive improvements. So, I think that that's the area that we are particularly keen to work on: making sure that more of our children perform at the OECD average at level 5 and level 6. Clearly, we've got more work to do on reading. We are working with southern Ireland, who have consistently done well with reading scores, to look to see what lessons we can learn to press on with there with reading."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. My final question on this. You recognise it as a priority, particularly for boys. Does that mean that the focus will then drift slightly from maths, where there has been some success; and drift from science, where the encouragement of more people to take GCSE science has reduced the number of high-level passes?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "First, we have to have a system that is capable of doing all of those of things at the same time. We can't accept a system that says, 'Well, we can do a bit over here, but that means we have to\u2014.' We have to have a system, Suzy, that can drive improvements at all levels. That's my expectation."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "The balloon needs to be bigger not just squeezing it at one end."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Absolutely, yes. That's my expectation of this system. You have to deliver across all of these. We have seen some progress. As I've said, it's far from perfect, and we've got more work to do, but we have to deliver across all three domains, as we did last time. And I'm not going to make any apologies for changing the performance indicators around science. It was a travesty that there were children who never had the opportunity to sit a science GCSE. We don't have to make assumptions about the nature of many, many, many of those children. We have seen a significant increase in the number of children who are having the opportunity to sit GCSE science and who are passing GCSE science. So, I'm not going to make any apologies about that. One of the reasons that I suspect we have ended up with poor science scores is because of the previous policy around science entries and science qualifications. Again, one of the reasons that we have changed it isn't just solely because we need to do better in PISA, but I think that by changing it, we will see an impact on PISA."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you for that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "The final set of questions is from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "I just want to discuss an issue that I know is important to you, namely closing the attainment gap between pupils who are eligible for free school meals and those who are not eligible for free school meals. Unfortunately, the problem persists, doesn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes. We are not where we need to be in terms of the performance, not only of our children on free school meals, but the performance of our looked-after children, and the performance of some children from some ethnic minority groups. So, we will continue to look to support those learners in a variety of ways, again looking to amend our practice on the basis of evidence that is given to us from our experts who are there to advise us. There is clearly more that we need to do. There has been some progress in some areas, but it is not where I would want it to be."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "But, this is despite the fact that there is \u00a3475 million that has been invested in the pupil development grant, for this exact purpose of closing the attainment gap. But, the problem persists, and in some places, it's deteriorating."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I think that, as I said, I am not shying away from any assumption or declaration that we need to do better. But, I do think that we need to acknowledge where progress has been made. If we go back to look at what PISA has said about our performance, the PISA results show that pupils in Wales are relatively more able to overcome the disadvantage of their background than is the average in OECD countries. So, our children are doing better in that, and that gives me encouragement. That's not me saying that; that's there. If we look at pupils who are eligible for free school meals, they do score below their better-off counterparts in PISA by some 34 points. The gap in England is 40 points. So, again, that gap is smaller here in Wales. If we look at basic levels of qualifications, back in\u2014. It's difficult to make comparisons because of all the reasons we have talked about, but if we look back to 2006 and we look at the very basic level of qualifications, which is a level 1 qualification, we have seen a jump from 9.4 per cent of children in 2006 achieving a level 1 qualification to over 18 per cent. So, there is progress. There is evidence that the resources that we are spending are making a difference. But, clearly, we are not where we would want to be. That's why we will continue to focus those resources on those children, where we need it. But, we need to do that earlier. Sticking plasters in years 10 and 11 aren't going to cut it. We need to get this right for those children, the moment that they come into a nursery and the moment that they start their formal education at the age of 5. That's how we are going to make the difference. Providing catch-up, of course, we need to do for those kids; we can't throw those year 10s and year 11s to the wind. We have to support those children. But, we will see real improvement when we get in there earlier."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "But I'm sure that that is a disappointment to you, because it has been a personal priority for you as well. In terms of minority ethnic learners, while there are some groups within that category who are achieving, there is underachievement happening here as well, isn't there? It's not consistent across the minority ethnic group. Is that something that you will be focusing upon?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, and that's why we have committed to maintaining a ring-fenced grant to local authorities of some \u00a310 million, to support education of our minority ethnic children. But, again, you are right, you are absolutely right, Si\u00e2n. We need a much more sophisticated conversation about what is really going on in attainment across minority ethnic groups so that we can best target that resource and have a conversation about what the differences are. You are absolutely correct: there is a real mixed picture. If we look at black Welsh girls entitled to free school meals, they perform almost at the national average for all children\u2014not FSM children; the national average for all children. Black Welsh boys don't, but neither do white Welsh boys. So, there is a really complex picture here, and I really welcome a debate about acknowledging the various levels of performance of BAME children, and where the gaps in performance lie. You are quite right: it is a complex picture in the system. I'm committed to continuing to support educational opportunities, and that's why have ring-fenced the minority ethnic achievement grant. There are some interesting data there. Some children are doing very, very well; others, we need to concentrate on."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Si\u00e2n, this will need to be the last question, I'm afraid."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Sorry?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "This is going to have to be the last question."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "The last question."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Fine. In terms of looked-after children, which is one of the groups where attainment isn't where we would like it to be, there was some improvement in 2016 at key stage 4, but it has been disappointing. Do we know what's been happening in 2019?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "The 2019 data will be published next month, and there has been significant activity. You are right: in recent years, the data have been poor and not where we would want it to be. That's why we have had a reformed approach to PDG LAC; the employment of PDG LAC co-ordinators across the regions. We've identified new resource in the new financial year to test new approaches, so, for instance, virtual school approaches, where we know, in other systems, that has worked. But, we expect the next set of data around the performance of this particular group of learners in March."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay, and you hope to see progress."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I don't want to speculate, but I hope so."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you very much.

Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies for absence this morning. Can I ask if there are any declarations of interest from Members, please? No. Okay. Thank you. Item 3 this morning then is a scrutiny session on early childhood education and care, and I'm very pleased to welcome Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Jo-anne Daniels, director of communities and tackling poverty at Welsh Government; and Nicola Edwards, deputy director of the childcare, play and early years division in Welsh Government. Thank you all for your attendance. We\u2019re very much looking forward to the session. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first ones are from Hefin David."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Good morning, Deputy Minister. What are your primary objectives? Is it supporting the development of children or getting parents into work?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, I think you'll be aware from the range of programmes that we've got that we do feel it\u2019s important to support both children and parents. There's obviously lots of evidence to show how important the early years are for children, how important they are for their development, and so, that is one of our primary objectives. But we also know how important it is for parents to have stable jobs, reasonably paid, so that can also help with the development of the children. So, we really see it that our plans are for both parents and children, and we believe that a high-quality, early-childhood education and care system can provide that. And, of course, in terms of when we talk about jobs as well, I think it\u2019s really important to remember that the childcare system is a big employer as well and a very important employer. So that, actually, itself provides jobs."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, the evidence we've seen suggests that, historically, Governments in the UK and devolved have focused on primarily getting parents into work. So, are you suggesting then that your focus is to change that and move towards early child development?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "No, what I'm saying is that we want to give parents the opportunity to work. We don't want childcare to be a barrier to parents working because we think that working is one the best routes out of poverty, but we do also want to make sure that children have the greatest experience that they can have in the early years. So, we see it as one."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. And that's quite a policy challenge to deliver both at the same time."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "The situation as it is is complex, and I think it needs simplifying. It is a challenge, but it\u2019s probably one of the most important challenges we've got in Government, because what we offer to families with young children is one of the most important things we do."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And in your evidence to the committee, you said that the Welsh Government\u2019s approach 'will build on a wide variety of programmes that are continually developing in order to support parents, families and children during the early years.' And you've just said you want to simplify that. How do you simplify that, particularly with regard to the provision of funding and the way these things connect from the birth of a child into school? How will simplification look, and what will happen?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, we're not at the stage of being able to say what it will look like at the moment, but we're looking at ways of simplifying, because I think it\u2019s absolutely right, it is a very complex system, because it\u2019s grown up from all different routes. But we are having lots of pilot projects that are looking at ways of simplifying the system. We have got pathway projects in, I think it\u2019s eight local authorities, who are looking at ways of joining up the whole system. So, we are looking at that, and I absolutely except that it is very complex and we want to find ways of making it simpler and easier to understand. So, we are working with local authorities and health boards to see how we can actually work together and simplify things."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And it's good to hear that that's your objective.

Some of this work has been going on for a year or so, and we're getting the results of those pathfinder projects coming in. So, when we do have all those results, we will be able to say the direction that we want to go in, and I hope we'll be able to do that very soon."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Before Christmas?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I hope so."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay.

Is the focus there on the child or is it on parents returning to work?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "The focus is on an early years system, but we've worked both locally and nationally. So, it's looking at both. I mean, actually, I think, perhaps, Nicola, would you like to or one of you like to describe one of the programmes?"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And can you just explain the vision? Is it a child-centred early years provision that we're thinking of in these pathfinder\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "So, in 'Prosperity for All', we set out that early years was one of the key priority areas, and within that we said that we wanted to create a more joined-up and more responsive system. So, when we talk about a system, we're talking about the services that are provided by health boards, so health visiting, midwifery, speech and language support, other kinds of therapeutic services, as well as all the important services that local authorities are providing, such as support for parenting, advice and guidance, employment support and childcare, obviously. And we've got eight pathfinders. I'll try and remember each of them. So, Flintshire, Newport, Blaenau Gwent, Neath Port Talbot, Swansea, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire\u2014and then I've missed one, I think, because I've only got to seven\u2014who have been working with us to look at how all of those services are currently delivered in their local area and whether and how they can reorganise those services to improve accessibility, to improve take-up, but essentially to improve the efficacy of those programmes in terms of supporting children, but often, obviously, in supporting children you have to support parents too and support the home."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "So, would you say it's a child-centred approach?"}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "Absolutely, because it's about making sure that we deliver the best start in life for children in Wales, but obviously parents are a critical element of that, so can't be excluded."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "And how long have they been going for?"}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "So, those eight pathfinders started their work in\u2014I think it was\u2014February this year. And they're still in the very early stages in terms of actually unpicking and mapping the current provision of services across their areas and then moving on to the stage where they'll develop proposals for how they might change the delivery of early years."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Julie."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Just to say also, the one in Flintshire is also testing the impact of consistent funding rates for education and childcare. So, that's been going longer than the others. So, that's another important area because there's an evaluation of that project under way at the moment."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "Sorry, but Caerphilly was the one that I forgot to mention."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Oh dear. [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "That's absolutely unforgivable. [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Hefin. [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Very significant."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "In your report, the 'Alignment of the Childcare Offer for Wales to the Foundation Phase', one of the recommendations was that 'The Welsh Government, local authority education and childcare policy and delivery teams could merge'. So, looking behind the scenes, those disparate parts of policy, delivering the foundation phase and childcare offer should merge. Is that the case? Has that been put under way and should we be looking at this structure in more depth?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, probably not at the structure at this time because the report that you're referring to was looking at the first year of the delivery of the childcare offer and it did make a number of points, which we have taken on board. For example, we issued guidance last year regarding the delivery of the foundation phase, which supports widening the number of non-maintained settings that are able to deliver early education and we're also supporting co-location and partnership working between education and childcare providers through our capital investment programme. I think it's about \u00a381 million that we put into the capital investment where we are developing\u00a0childcare facilities co-located with the education facilities, because that was one of the things that came out from this report you're referring to. And, I mean, obviously, early years is one of the key priorities within 'Prosperity for All' and, obviously, education sits within one portfolio with the Minister for Education, and childcare is with me. But we're doing what we can to work together to try to bring those together, and that was one of the proposals in that report. But it's still very early to think about, at this stage, a structural change."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And I remember when you were on the committee here with me, sitting next to me, we had those discussions about co-location. I know the problem with not having co-location is that you could end up seeing a child travelling between three or more locations during the course of a day. Are you suggesting now that the actions you're taking will resolve that issue universally, or will it lead to a piecemeal resolution? And, if so, to what extent, what percentage of children will see that resolved as an issue?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Certainly, the co-location is not going to solve it universally because although we've been able to develop a lot of new facilities, or build on old facilities, there will be a lot of areas that we won't have covered. So, I can't say that there's going to be a situation where everything is going to be co-located because I don't think that would be feasible, and,for some of the providers, they wouldn't be in a position to move to a school. But ideally it's a good situation, but, certainly, I think the discussions that there were on the committee, it's not ideal to take children for long distances between different providers, let alone the effect it has on the climate change issue. It's whether it's good for children as well. So, I can't say that they will ever be co-located, but as I said in response to your earlier question, we are encouraging the development of the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, which, obviously, is quite significant."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. I've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. What is the Welsh Government doing to address the big differences in the amount of early childhood education and care provision available in different parts of Wales?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Right. Well, thank you very much for that question. I mean, obviously, it would be good to see a greater degree of consistency, but I think it's important to acknowledge that there are reasons for that variation. Now, early education, of course, is the responsibility of the Minister for Education, and we are aware that different local authorities have adopted different patterns of providing early education. For example, local authorities are funded to provide 10 hours minimum of the foundation phase for three and four-year-olds across Wales, but there's quite a variance in how much is actually provided, with some local authorities providing a lot more historically. So, it does mean that there is a different pattern across Wales, according to what local authorities do. But what I could say is, of course, the quality is very good, as the Estyn reports have shown; that the quality provided, the delivery of the foundation phase, is very good. But it does vary in terms of what is offered throughout Wales, and that is the decision of the local authorities, and it is a historical thing. I refer to this pilot in Flint, which is trying to test paying the same rate for foundation phase and childcare. We're going to have an independent evaluation on that soon, in November this year, so that will help us. Obviously, I think local authorities' role in all this is absolutely crucial because they are the local, nearest people to decide how things develop in their own areas. And then, of course, we've got Flying Start, which is geographically targeted, which uses the data from income benefit to decide which are the areas where that is being delivered. And that is delivered where the highest proportion of children aged nought to three are living in income-dependent households. So, again, that determines the pattern throughout Wales. With Flying Start being geographically targeted, with the education being determined by the local authorities about how much there is, we know that there is a variance throughout Wales. We'd like to see facilities developed in each local authority throughout Wales that would answer the needs of the families and the children in those areas."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Before you move on, Janet, Si\u00e2n's got a supplementary."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Just in terms of the foundation phase, there have been cuts, of course, in expenditure in that phase. How concerned are you about that and the impact that that will have on the way in which the foundation phase is taught in our schools? The foundation phase is now part of the education improvement grant, which has seen a reduction of 10 per cent, and it has to compete against other expenditure streams within that greater pot of funding. So, are you concerned that money is being lost and that that will have an impact on standards in the foundation phase?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I haven't seen any evidence. Obviously, I must reiterate the foundation phase does come under the Minister for Education, but I haven't seen any evidence of any standards being lowered, and the reports from Estyn are very good. In fact, I think the foundation phase is one of our great joys, that we absolutely celebrate it, and so I'd be very concerned if I thought there was any drop in standards in the foundation phase, and I certainly haven't had any evidence of that. I would want to guard against that."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Exactly, but if there are fewer teaching assistants in the system because of the cuts, it's going to impact on standards, at the end of the day."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think we have to be very careful to see that lower standards are not implemented, because it was groundbreaking when we brought it in, and it has proved to be a great success, so we want to make sure that's guarded."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Janet."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Going back to my original question about the big differences in amounts of early childhood education and care provision in different parts of Wales, the Welsh and UK Governments have followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market, with subsidies mainly given to working parents. Is that a mistake? Should it be more universally available?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, some of our provision is universally available in certain areas. For example, the Flying Start provision is universally available in geographically defined areas, and I think that's very important, because that does mean that there isn't stigma, and so,in those areas, everybody can take advantage of it, and yet it is reaching those who are most in need because it's reaching those areas. So, I think that there is a purpose behind that. In terms of when you say demand led, could you elaborate on that?"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "I know that\u2014we've just had a useful briefing from\u00a0David Dallimore, and, basically, there is this theory that there are too many resources\u2014the demand-driven approach is based more on certain factors: geographic spread in terms of it being more universal, and whether that's the right way. How do children then mix with peers from different backgrounds, in their own peer or age group?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "It is demand\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "[Inaudible.]\u2014because the offer is targeted at working parents\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Yes, yes."}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "\u2014obviously, then the amount of availability is based on how many parents apply for it and take it up. Is that the context of demand led in that\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "Right, okay."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "It is universally available to all parents who meet the eligibility criteria of working, and I think what you're saying is that it should be available to everybody."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "I think the point that Janet's making is that some areas have traditionally got more childcare anyway because they have traditionally had more demand in those areas, so there's not a level playing field to start from. Is that correct?"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think that, historically, that is definitely true, and when you look at the take-up of the childcare offer, it's certainly taken up in some areas with a very high take-up rate. I think Ynys M\u00f4n was nearly 90 per cent or something\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "They need more money, because they haven't got enough funding."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "So does everywhere."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "No, to meet the demand."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "In other areas, it's much, much lower\u2014in some of the cities, I know. So, there is a big range in take-up\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "So, do you intend to bring something forward to address that?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "We are planning to extend it. We're looking at the possibility of extending it to parents who are in education and training. So, we are widening the offer, yes. Obviously, we have to wait for the evaluation\u00a0of that.\u00a0It would be great to be able to offer it to absolutely everybody, but obviously we have got the finance to look at in terms of how we do that. But we are certainly planning to expand it."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "We've got questions on the offer in a little while. Janet."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Does the Welsh Government intend to develop an integrated approach, then, against all settings? If so, given the current inconsistencies, how can quality be assured?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "We are developing a more integrated approach towards the early years. As I've said, we're trying to have the foundation phase operating in more non-maintained settings, and we're already developing that. But Estyn and CIW will continue to inspect and regulate the early years sector to ensure standards, and, since January 2019, CIW and Estyn have moved to joint inspections for the non-maintained settings that are offering the foundation phase. So, that is a very positive move, I think, and is absolutely making sure that standards are maintained, because if we are having the foundation phase in non-maintained settings, that is a challenge where we want to be sure that the standards and the philosophy of the foundation phase are maintained. So, we have got the system of inspection to ensure that."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "And finally from me, what specific steps have been put in place to take forward the commitments from the Welsh Government's 2017 childcare/play early years workforce plan to build a better understanding of the workforce's Welsh language skills to enable support for the sector to be targeted and to identify where capacity needs to be built for the future to meet the needs of the early years sector in a bilingual Wales?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "We think this is very important, and we're pleased that 29 per cent of children taking up the childcare offer are in Welsh or bilingual settings, so we think that's very good. We have established a specific programme to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and play workforce with the National Centre for Learning Welsh, to develop workplace Welsh language skills across the sector. So, we're actually working with that, and I think you've done something with those recently, haven't you? I don't know if you want to\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "Yes. So, we have a stakeholder group where we've brought together a variety of people with an interest in the early years, childcare and play sectors, and we had a presentation just last month from the national language centre about the education programmes that they're rolling out, and how this is all coming together, which is quite interesting. We've been working quite carefully to make sure that the variety of work-based learning programmes that we provide and offer are also available in Welsh and bilingually. Recruitment and retention within the childcare and play sector is quite challenging in any\u00a0 case. Recruiting and retaining staff with really good Welsh language skills adds an extra dimension to it, and\u00a0that it's a point that Mudiad Meithrin makes to us quite regularly, that they do struggle to find staff with the right skills. So, upskilling the existing workforce is a key part of it, but also doing more to attract people in with Welsh language skills in the first place in terms of the training courses that we're taking forward, and thinking about that in the context of the targets within Cymraeg 2050 and the aim to get to one million Welsh speakers. So, as the Deputy Minister said, we've got quite a number of children accessing the offer in Welsh-medium or bilingual settings at the moment. We're going to be doing some baselining work against that in terms of local authorities' Welsh in education strategic plans and education places, and what we can then do to increase the number of childcare places in parallel with that so that you can make sure that you start that pathway through learning Welsh, interacting with education and childcare through Welsh at a much earlier stage."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Suzy, you've got a supplementary."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Just on this early point, anybody who's been through the Welsh education system, which is 20 years now, will have some Welsh language skills, obviously to differing degrees. For the entrants that are coming into childcare training now, there are going to be very few of them, realistically, with no Welsh at all, so what's actually being incorporated into the early years care training to make sure, at that stage, that the Welsh language skills are being developed, as opposed to an add-on later on?"}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "You're quite right. Most people coming through the education system will have some awareness of Welsh although I think it's probably important to remember we do also employ people from outside of wales."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, but the majority, being realistic."}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "But they don't necessarily have Welsh that is appropriate. They've got Welsh that they've developed in school. It's not necessarily appropriate for then teaching that language to children, who may be coming from families who don't use Welsh at home. So, that might be the first interaction that child has with the language. So, there's a lot of that in terms of child development and how you develop children bilingually, particularly if they're coming from English-medium homes, and reinforcing the language in language choices. There will also be some people who are, perhaps\u2014we see this quite a lot in the office\u2014quite confident in terms of speaking Welsh but less so in terms of some of the paperwork, the reporting, the writing and the interacting with parents more officially, which we need to think about as well. But it is mainly about getting people to a point where they can transmit that language onwards in a confident and meaningful way."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay.

With the way we do it, it's because of the way that the setting defines their language category, and that's how we collect it. We do go down to individual child level, although it's anonymised, data collection on a termly basis. So I'll have a look and see if we can send you through the last term."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Maybe if the committee could have a note, that would be really useful."}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "Yes, that's fine."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "We've got some questions now on childcare from Dawn Bowden."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. Deputy Minister, the evaluation of the childcare offer, when it was published last year, said that there was very little evidence currently available to determine what its impact was. You're going to be producing a second evaluation in November this year; do you expect to see some indications now of the impact?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, the evaluation of the first year of the childcare offer was very limited, because the childcare offer wasn't available throughout the whole of Wales. And it was a very early implementation phase. So, obviously it takes time to grow. And the evaluation for year 2, I think, will also show a limited impact for the same reasons. The offer became available across the whole of Wales only last April. So we've only got since last April that it's actually been fully available. And the parental survey was released to parents in June 2019, therefore any impact on parents in the authorities coming on board in the second year will also be negligible. So, it's from the next one, however, we hope that we will get more information."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "So you think, by the time we get to November 2020, you might have a better picture."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "The evaluation will be more meaningful, we think, then, yes."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. I take that point. What the first year's evaluation did show, however, was that 94 per cent of respondents said that they were already using formal childcare before the offer came into place. A couple of things, really: are you surprised at that, and is that likely to inform the way that you develop the offer in the future?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "No, I'm not surprised at all. When it started off, it was only available in seven local authorities. In terms of how the families found out that it was available, they found it out through the childcare providers, where they already had their children there. So it was absolutely what we would have expected, and that will continue. But, of course, we were not able to fully advertise the childcare offer until it was available in all the local authorities, which was last April. So we are planning, this autumn, quite a big push now to try to make it available to everybody\u2014so everybody knows about it. So, no, this is the pattern we would have expected, and I think anybody who's involved in starting up something in childcare will know you have to wait a number of years before you actually see it being fully taken up."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "I guess the question that it raises in my mind is: does this mean that, actually, it hasn't been an incentive to get somebody back into work, because they were already in work and already had childcare provision? What you've done is you've directed money to people who were already spending that money anyway. So it hasn't been a move towards getting people into work because they couldn't afford childcare."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well I think that that is something that we are moving towards, because the take-up of the offer is actually increasing each month, which is why I call it a great success. At the end of July, we hit almost 16,000 children accessing the offer, which obviously means that there are 16,000 families benefiting from this, and the feedback that we have had from parents is that they have been able to\u2014. They've got more money available, which is obvious, which is great, because obviously more money is available to plunge into the economy and carry out that sort of thing, and we've got examples of parents who've been supported into work through programmes like Parents, Childcare and Employment to begin with, and then have gone on to access the offer. So, that's again a progression. So, I think we are seeing signs that people are moving on, have got more ability to be flexible in the work that they're doing, but I hope that when we look at it again, we will be able to see people actually moving into work because of having the access to childcare."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. Before\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Are you going to move on? Si\u00e2n's got a supplementary."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Just a question on funding for the childcare offer. If you foresee that there's going to be more people going to be taking up that offer through the fact that you're marketing it more, what if the same situation arises that has happened on Anglesey? The take-up has been very good there, but the money that the Welsh Government has been allocating to Anglesey doesn't match that. What if it happens in every local authority right across Wales? Are you confident there's going to be plenty of money available to respond to that demand?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Based on the current levels of take-up and looking at the rates of increase each month, we expect to spend in the region of \u00a350 million to \u00a355 million in this financial year. Our published plans already include the provision of \u00a340 million, and we're absolutely committed to making available the total funding that is needed to deliver on the offer. It is fantastic to see the offer being so well received on Ynys M\u00f4n, recognising, as Janet said earlier, it is demand led. We are managing it within the normal budgetary process. Local authorities will get the full funding that is needed. It's this year now that the big increase has happened; the previous two years\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "So, local authorities won't have to find the extra money out of their own pots."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "No, absolutely not. This is funded by the Welsh Government."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes. You can assure them."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Dawn."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. You've already alluded to this in answer to Janet earlier on, about extending the childcare offer to those in training and education. You also talk about 'on the cusp' of returning to work. So, I'm not quite sure what 'on the cusp' of returning to work is, but from the committee's point of view, we're very pleased that you've reached that conclusion, because it was one of the recommendations that we had following the scrutiny of the Bill. So, can you say a little more about that, bearing in mind that I'm also conscious that you've told Hefin you're going to be making an announcement shortly? So you may not be able to say too much. But a little bit more about the inclusion of parents in training and education, what 'on the cusp of returning to work' is\u2014what that means from your perspective\u2014and how you've arrived at that decision now, six months into the programme. What is it that's made you move towards that conclusion?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, obviously, the children and young persons committee made a very good case for education and training, in particular; I think that was one of the things that was at the top of the list. What we've committed to do is to review the programme, particularly looking at how we could bring in education and training, and that review will report early next year. So, early next year, we will have a view on how we could go forward. But the other thing that's also happened is that, obviously, with the new First Minister, that was one of his manifesto commitments\u2014that he would bring education and training in. So, we're obviously following the\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Because that was one of the key drivers for that as well."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes, so that is another of the key drivers, as you said\u2014the committee and what the First Minister said. There are a wealth of programmes supporting parents into education, training or work, and many of those do provide support with childcare costs. But we have, by rolling out this programme, the childcare programme, highlighted some gaps where people have felt that they, particularly people who are in full-time education\u2014and I can think of a number of people who are actually doing PhD studies\u2014who are\u2014the letters may have come in from some of your constituents\u2014not able to access the offer as things stand. So, we are looking at people who are in full-time education and training. We're using the definition by the Office for National Statistics, aren't we, in terms of education and training. And on 'on the cusp of work', maybe that will have to be something we have to look at differently\u2014those people who are actually maybe undertaking very short training programmes, preparation for work, maybe actually having interviews, where they need help with childcare, that they're sort of almost there. So, they may have to be dealt with in a different way, but I think we do want to look at those. This is expanding the offer; it's not making it universal, but it's moving on."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "So, what are the\u2014? Overall, then, what are the factors that you're having to take into account? Is it going to be what is needed in order to encourage people back into work? Is it going to be cost? Is it going to be a combination of all of those things? What are going to be the key factors that you're going to be looking at?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, the position now is that anybody who fulfills the criteria in terms of the number of hours they work, we would look at that in terms of education and training, and then, this expression 'on the cusp of work' we may have to look at differently, because they may not fulfil those numbers in terms of number of hours training. So, we'll get a criteria, and then they will have access to the childcare offer. But I just have to emphasise that there are ways of getting help with childcare already, and we wanted to make sure we don't duplicate. That's why this field is so complex, shall we say, because there's so many different ways that you can actually get help, and we want to be sure that we don't duplicate\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Sorry, Julie. So, all of this is going to be incorporated in this announcement that you're going to be making shortly\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "No, this review will report early next year."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. My final question\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Before you move on, sorry, I've got a couple of supplementaries. I've got Suzy, then Si\u00e2n. Sorry, Dawn."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Just on the cost element, because if you do roll out this programme, obviously, on the back of evidence through a review, it is going to cost extra money. Early years is one of the eight priority areas for Government. There are fairly generous Barnett consequentials coming from the comprehensive spending review and announcements on schools from the UK Government, and while I accept that you've only got annual commitments there, they're still substantial. How much money have you managed to secure for early years from the most recent announcement, and when have you planned to actually use that, maybe for some of this work?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Have you got some information on that?"}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "The budget process is ongoing internally, so I think 'secured' is probably a slightly premature phrase."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Am I allowed to ask instead how much you've asked for, then? All I'm after is some reassurance that you will be getting some of this money, and as it is one of the eight priorities, certainly we would expect to see you getting a substantial amount of money for early years."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "As one of the Government's priorities, we would expect to get any money that came as a result of any Barnett consequentials."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. And it will be in the draft budget that we know for sure if it is successful."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "It's all in the process\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "And the committee will want to look very carefully at that, obviously."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "It's in the process at the moment."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "There we are. Just giving you a good warning."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "How much would it cost to move to a child-centred approach, which means that every child would be able to access the childcare offer, rather than doing it from parents?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "We are looking at that. We're having a longer-term review, in terms of what it would mean if every child had access to the childcare offer. We don't have those figures yet. We've got the one review looking at bringing in education and training. That should report early next year, and then we've got another longer-term review, looking at what a universal offer would mean."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Do we know how many children we're talking about?"}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "Yes. So, there are approximately, at any given time, around 73,000 three and four-year-olds in Wales. There's some slight rounding in the numbers there, but approximately 73,000 at any given time. Based on the current eligibility criteria for the offer, it's about 34,000 children, we believe, are eligible. This does, of course, vary, depending on a whole range of different factors, and we certainly know from what we're seeing from the offer that, even where people are entitled to something, they don't necessarily take it up. And even if they do take it up, they don't necessarily take up their full entitlement, which is also something that we'd have to think about in terms of any modelling on costings."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "So, half the children are in non-working families."}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "It's because of the requirement that, in a two-parent household, both parents must be in work."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes. Two parent. Okay."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "One of the points that the committee made very strongly in our report on the Bill was that we wanted to see a much more child-centred focus, and one of the issues that came out in scrutiny was whether, actually, three and four-year-olds were the right age to be actually targeting if we're looking at things like child development. Have you given any consideration to the actual age group that's covered when we know that, for many children, it's the first 1,000 days that makes that fundamental difference?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "We are aware that there is a case that says that two years old is a very important time. We are looking at that as part of the overall longer review, yes. We are aware of the information and what you're saying about the younger the better."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Dawn."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Yes, my final question, Chair, thank you, is about the parent, childcare and employment programme, which is jointly funded by the European social fund and Welsh Government. It has been quite successful, in terms of its numbers anyway, in getting economically inactive parents into work. What are the plans for this programme, if and when we leave the EU and we lose the ESF funding for that?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, the programme has recently been extended, with delivery continuing until June 2022, with additional ESF funding of \u00a35.6 million. That's recently happened, and obviously this programme provides intensive employment to parents who are not in education, employment or training or economically inactive and where the childcare is the main barrier, and it has been a very, very successful programme. So, the UK has guaranteed funding for all EU projects approved by December 2020, and this includes the PaCE programme. I think there was also another\u2014. I only heard it verbally. I heard some other guarantees on the radio recently from the UK Treasury about guaranteeing some of these funds. I don't know whether anybody else heard that. But the Welsh Government can only draw on the UK Government guarantee for claims that aren't paid by the European Commission, and so the current arrangements are staying in place."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Until when, sorry?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, June 2022."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Oh, I see. Yes. So, that's when all the current commitments expire, basically. Yes. So, we don't know\u2014. To do that it would have to be part of Government planning in terms of\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, we don't know what's happening with that\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "\u2014what would happen beyond that."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "\u2014funding, but there have been some promises from the UK Government recently, but nothing definite."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Yes, we're not holding our breath."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "No."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Si\u00e2n's got some specific questions now around the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "As we know, of course, the work with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs has ended, and I know you weren't the Minister who initiated this process, but what exactly has gone wrong? What are these issues that have come to light that have made you suspend that? It's very frustrating for us, as a committee, who scrutinised that extensively and raised a lot of concerns about that. And a lot of time has been spent talking about this funding Bill, and money\u2014\u00a31 million, I understand\u2014has been wasted, if you like, unnecessarily. So, what exactly has gone wrong? Why aren't you discussing these things with HMRC?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": ""}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes. So, thank you for that explanation."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I've got more to say as well."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes, but for your transparency around your particular\u00a0view that it needs to be more flexible and expanded upon and, therefore, going down the HMRC route was\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "It would have restricted us a lot."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes. We knew that from the beginning. I mean, that's, you know\u2014. So, it was a principle decision rather than any sort of technical matters to do with the Welsh language standards. That's been cited as one kind of\u2014. But I'm really understanding more now that, really, what it's about is that you want to have a more flexible, and expand on the offer and that this would curtail\u2014going through HMRC would put limits on that."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "That is one of the reasons, but there were issues about the Welsh language, which we can go into in detail, if you'd like. There were some issues about that. They would be able to process things bilingually, and I think that was probably told to the committee when we looked at the HMRC. But, in terms of the Welsh language standards that the Minister has to use, there would be some difficulties in them doing it."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "But would you say that your main change came about because you wanted to be more flexible rather than any difficulties\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "One of the major reasons, I think\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. Good."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "But there are\u2014. As I say, there are other reasons. Those technical reasons probably do end up being quite important\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "But the committee was told by the previous Minister that HMRC wouldn't have any problem at all with delivering according to the Welsh language standards."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Do you want to add something to this?"}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "So, in terms of some of the technical issues we had, if you want to start with the bilingual provision and the Welsh language standards, HMRC do provide a bilingual service at the moment for their customers in line with their Welsh language scheme, and I think we can all appreciate that schemes are quite different from the requirements of the standards. And there were some issues when we got into the detail of the standards that the Welsh Ministers are required to deliver to that caused some concerns in terms of how HMRC were going to do it, particularly in terms of the multiple IT systems that go into building up the childcare services. So, for example, there are a number of what are called 'special characters' in the Welsh alphabet, such as the to bach, for example. The HMRC IT system has some issues with that."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes, well, with due respect, the to bach has always been there\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "Oh, yes, I completely agree. Unfortunately, however\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "\u2014and HMRC would have been able to tell you, really early on, you would have thought, that it was\u2014. I don't really want to go into it, because I think we've got to the crux of why HMRC was dropped. I think it's been dropped because Julie feels that the offer needs to be more flexible, and I can understand why you would say that."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "If we bring in training and education, for example, we wouldn't be able to do that via the HMRC, it would have to be done by the local authorities. Foster parents have to be done via the local authorities. Any people of immigration status of no resource from public funds, that would have to be done via the local authorities. And with the local authorities also wanting to do it\u2014. I mean, there are other things with using HMRC\u2014if any changes were made with the English offer, for example, because this would be delivered via HMRC with the English offer, that would cause difficulties for the Welsh offer. So, we wanted something more flexible. I don't know if there's anything more you want to add on that."}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "The only thing I'd add is that\u2014and, again, I think the Minister has referred to this\u2014the costs that HMRC presented us with at the end of the discovery phase were significantly higher than the costs that had initially been outlined and that we outlined to the committee in the regulatory impact assessment. So, our conclusion is that we can deliver a cheaper system and a system that has the flexibility that the Deputy Minister has referred to by working with local authorities rather than HMRC. So, there is an important issue around value for money as well and making sure that the investment that we're making into developing the national system is one that\u2014that, in a sense, that investment stays in Wales. So, obviously, the money that we're paying over to HMRC to run the system would be supporting HMRC and their employees wherever they may be based, many of them not based in Wales; investment in local authorities to administer the system means that we're retaining more of that investment here."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Well, I congratulate you on persuading local government and WLGA to change their minds, because they actually told this committee that they favoured the HMRC option\u2014and this is only going back a few months\u2014because it will remove\u2014and this is quoting them\u2014 'it will remove the administrative burden of receiving applications and checking eligibility from local authorities'\u2014 blah, blah, blah, blah.\u00a0So, they've obviously changed their minds as well, which is, you know\u2014. I congratulate you on that, but it does present us as a committee with a little bit of a problem, really, because, if we're told one thing a few months ago and then we're told something completely different today, you know, evidence\u2014we have to go on evidence that we've heard, and the evidence has changed now."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think, during the period since it was discussed on the committee, the work with the HMRC has helped highlight to us where we needed to go. So, I think we did learn a lot and it certainly has helped show to us where we think is the best place to go. I would like to pay tribute to the local authorities, because they've been great partners in this and they're very positive about moving forward keeping the work. And there's also a feeling that, because they are so much closer to the local public than HMRC is, they're able to build up links with families and help with some of these difficult issues. Because I'm sure many of you may have had individual cases\u2014I certainly have\u2014where there's been quite a lot of complexity about helping people fill in the forms and look at their eligibility. So, I say well done to the local authorities.

Ms Daniels, you referred to value for money. How much is it actually going to cost to change this system from being a temporary arrangement with local authorities to a permanent one? And how much more is it going to cost for the more flexible system that you have in mind? They're not going to do this for nothing. How much extra are you giving them, and will they use it for this? How are you ensuring it's used for this?"}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "So, at the moment, local\u2014. So, two things. Just to start by saying the eligibility checking process is not undertaken by all 22 local authorities."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "No, no, I realise that.\u00a0Yes, I got all that."}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "So, part of the reason for using 10 is to try to ensure that we build economies of scale and that we have a more efficient operation.\u00a0Those authorities that undertake that function are given a specific grant in order to do that. That grant is ring-fenced to that purpose."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Could you give us an idea of the price tag?"}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "At the moment, it's about \u00a32.5 million."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, just as a round figure\u2014that's fine."}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "Just for the administration. They get separate funding for the childcare, obviously."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "So that, as I said, is a ring-fenced sum that they use to administer the offer. We are now starting the detailed work to define the new system requirements so that we will have a single application process across Wales, moving forward. As part of that work, we'll need to consider the detailed costings, but our initial estimate suggests that it would be less than the cost proposed by HMRC."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, when those costings are worked up, perhaps we could have a note comparing the two figures."}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "Yes, we would be very happy to share more detail on that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "If it became a universal offer, would those costs reduce? Would there be so much bureaucracy involved in checking eligibility and stuff if every child was open to the offer?"}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "So, clearly, if every child is eligible, then a large part of the process falls away in terms of the need to verify income and so on. That doesn't mean that there's no administration. For example, with the foundation phase, which is universally available, there is an application process and there is an administrative function that sits alongside that. At this point in time, I couldn't give you any indication of\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "But it would be substantially less, wouldn't it, because they wouldn't have to do all these eligibility checks and all those things?"}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "They wouldn't have to do the eligibility checks, but they would still have to make payments to the childcare providers and make sure they were paying for the right number of hours in respect of each child. So, parents would still need to tell them where their child was going, and there would still need to be some work alongside that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Si\u00e2n, do you want to ask about the Welsh language?"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "I think we've\u2014. I'm happy with that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Really\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "I don't think that that was the real reason why the change happened."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "One of the reasons."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Nevertheless, the committee was given very concrete assurances that the Welsh language side of this was going to be covered off. Have you got anything that you want to add on that? Obviously, for us as a committee, we believe what we're told when we are given assurances. So, that's quite concerning for us, really, that that suddenly then became an issue, when both HMRC and the Minister at the time told us that this wasn't going to be a problem."}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "So, I think it's the point that I was talking about earlier.

They do provide a bilingual service. It was just some of the specific details of the requirements placed on the Welsh Ministers, because it is the Welsh Ministers' standards that they would need to deliver against that they were struggling with."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Right, okay."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes, but those standards were there right from the very beginning."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "I think that the committee would feel that that should have been bottomed out at the beginning, really."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Nothing has changed in terms of the standards."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, just before we move on to Flying Start, can I just ask: the Minister mentioned a longer term review of the childcare offer. Are you able to give us any indication of when that will report, please?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Would we have any idea?"}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "We haven't set out a definitive timescale on that as of yet because we've been focusing very much on getting the review in terms of training, education and on the cusp of returning to work up and running. But sometime next year."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. So, it will report sometime next year."}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We'll move on now to Flying Start and questions from Suzy Davies."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. Can I just begin by asking you how you respond to the assertion that children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds do better in a mixed socioeconomic environment than in a targeted environment?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think that's what Flying Start does, isn't it? Yes, I would have thought that was likely."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, the reason I'm asking you that, of course, is because this committee has suggested, perhaps, changes to the outreach system to target more disadvantaged children, and not necessarily capture people who happen to be in a geographic area."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "So, you're saying that you feel that a universal offer in certain areas is not advantageous to\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, I'm asking you, really. If it's the case that we're only going after disadvantaged children, which would take very precise targeting\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I'm not only going after disadvantaged children. I feel that we should be offering something for all children, and our considerations are for all children. The reason we've targeted Flying Start is because it would be great if we had enough money to have Flying Start throughout the whole of Wales, but we just don't have that sort of money. Because I think Flying Start has proved to be a great\u2014very successful."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I'm going to ask you a few more questions on that. Because just in response to this committee's 2018 report, you did say that: 'defined geographical targeting of Flying Start support will be considered as part of the Welsh Government\u2019s work on the Early Years system.' That suggests you still have geographic targeting in mind. So, if you're looking at a very mixed source of economic experience for children, what are the geographic boundaries you're considering?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "At the moment, Flying Start can go beyond the geographical boundaries, with the extension\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "With limits, yes."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes. I think they can use 10 per cent of their income to go beyond the geographical boundaries, and many of them have done that. But, obviously, there are four elements to Flying Start, and only those geographical areas have got the four elements, but there could be the opportunity of extending some of that beyond the Flying Start geographical areas. We're looking at this."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I accept what you say about the current system\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I believe it's much more\u2014. I believe very strongly in having a universal system, where everybody is able to access it."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I appreciate that as well. But, obviously, there are huge cost implications for that\u2014unless you're giving us some insight into what you're going to say next week, I don't know. But actually, defining anything geographically, which now seems to be fairly arbitrary, because it's not targeted purely at disadvantaged children\u2014on what basis are we choosing the geographic areas we are choosing at the moment?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, they're chosen then because of the benefit take-up in those particular areas. So, it's reaching some of the poorest children, but not all of the poorest children, but it's reaching the poorest children in a way that is not stigmatising, and where the services are open to everybody, and I think that's very important."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Well, having established that, we have fairly recent research here that a third of children living in poverty in Wales are already falling behind at the age of five\u2014that suggests that two thirds of them aren't, but it's still a very worrying statistic. Not all children live in Flying Start areas; how are you going to reach that third who, even at such an early age, are already falling behind? How many of them are in Flying Start areas?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think the actual number of children in poverty, the most disadvantaged that we reach through the Flying Start areas\u2014I think it's about 46 per cent. Is that\u2014? Do you know the actual percentage?"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "It's about a quarter of total children are in there, but\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "So, just to give you a few of the numbers, there are just over 36,000 children benefiting from Flying Start services. That equates to about 23 per cent of children, overall, in Wales. And because of the nature of the benefit take-up data, and because we don't assess eligibility within a Flying Start area, we can't be absolutely certain how many children within a Flying Start area are actually in poverty. So, it's an estimate, and it's a range, and the range is that around 45 per cent of children in Flying Start areas would be in poverty.FootnoteLink"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, that's interesting. I would have expected it to be much higher than that, particularly if the geographic areas had been targeted on benefit claims, effectively. Are you disappointed that the proportion is\u2014basically, 55 per cent of those children aren't living in poverty. That's what you're saying, isn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "Well, I'd offer two observations. One: the nature of poverty in Wales is actually, generally, more dispersed than perhaps sometimes is appreciated. Yes, we have very concentrated areas of\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, actually, we do appreciate it, which is why we're asking this question. [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "Okay. So that's one issue to think about. Sorry, I've lost my train of thought now, in terms of the second\u2014oh, sorry: whether you're in or out of poverty is, in one sense, very black/white. But in reality of course\u2014in terms of the income definition, it's very black/white. But, of course, there will be a large number of people who are just above, but also families who move in and out, so it's quite a transient population in some senses, in terms of people having incomes that aren't stable, people having jobs that go with that that aren't stable. So, at any one point in time, you're only sort of capturing a snapshot of what's happening. In reality, it's a bit more complex than that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I accept that. I mentioned a third of children living in poverty had fallen behind at five; by the age of 14, half that number is still falling behind, so something has happened between that third and that half to improve the life chances of those individual children or young people. Is that attributable to Flying Start? Can you say that candidly? Or is it a happy coincidence, where there could be some causation, but we can\u2019t prove it?"}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "We certainly think that Flying Start is making a positive impact, both on the point at which children go to school, and then subsequently. And I think as the committee knows, we\u2019ve been working with the SAIL\u2014secure anonymised information linkage\u2014and the databank there to look at how we can do longitudinal studies to track children\u2019s progress, to look at the extent to which outcomes are effected by Flying Start interventions."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "We probably don't have time for this level of detail today, but half of those children are still behind at the age of 14. So, I'd be curious to know if there's any immediate plans to help them catch up or make sure that their successors don't fall into the same position, the same trap. Have you got anything high level that you can mention at this stage?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Just in terms of what we\u2019re thinking of doing with Flying Start\u2014. The key thing about Flying Start is the collaborative way that it works with the health visitors and all the speech and language therapists and childcare, and we\u2019re looking at ways of trying to get some of those elements to reach a wider group. And as I said, we talked about earlier the eight earlier years transformation pathfinders that we talked about in the local authorities\u2014we talked about that earlier\u2014so, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to look at Flying Start and how we can try to make it more accessible to more children. So, we do want to extend the benefits of Flying Start. We do want to make it available to more children, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at. And we\u2019re looking at that in those eight pathfinder areas. And you'll have to wait to see what we come up with\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "No, no\u2014we'll ask you more about that in due course. Actually, that job would be an awful lot easier if you knew how many children within Flying Start areas were taking up all four elements. Why don't you know that? Why is that data not collected?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Do we know why?"}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "So, the approach that we\u2019ve taken to evaluation in Flying Start\u2014. The committee will have seen the various evaluation reports that have been published, and I know that you\u2019re familiar with the work that, as I say, we\u2019ve been doing with SAIL. We\u2019re currently focusing on individual data collection, and through that we want to be able to report on levels of engagement, but also outcomes for children. We\u2019ve been piloting that new approach in six local authorities. We hope to be able to extend that, and we hope to be able to provide more evidence about the interventions and the impact that they then achieve."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. All right. Because, to be honest, I would want to know if a child\u2019s chances have improved primarily because they\u2019re getting good-quality childcare or primarily because their parents are taking up parenting courses. There\u2019s got to be some indication somewhere in here about which of these four elements is making the greatest difference."}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "I would just caution in terms of expectations. It will always be quite difficult to definitively provide answers to that, because many parents will be taking these things up in combination. So, disentangling which has had the effect is, obviously, quite tricky\u2014in particular, all parents will be getting the enhanced health visiting. Not every parent will take up parenting support, not every child will need speech and language help, so\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "And that's why we need to know who is."}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "Disentangling what's helped and what hasn't I think will always be quite a difficult thing to do."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "But it would also be helpful to know which combinations work best as well. Just on the final point from me\u2014yes, 88 per cent of Flying Start's childcare offers were taken up, but we've had some local authorities where the take-up has dropped dramatically. I think Denbighshire was down a fair bit, wasn't it, and Ceredigion, I think, had had a poor take-up. Have you got any indication why? I'm thinking of Denbighshire particularly, where there is a tradition\u2014taking up third-party childcare is cultural there, whereas in Ceredigion,\u00a0for example, there are far fewer places available in the first place and less of a tradition of children taking up childcare. But what's happened in Denbighshire?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think there are a number of different reasons why parents do decide not to use a facility, and, obviously, that always exists, but each local authority has a Flying Start account manager in place to support them in the delivery of the programme and the account management activities, and there are formal account meetings that look at this sort of thing once a year\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "So, what have they told you?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "\u2014and these meetings will take place in November 2019. That's when the specific delivery issues will be discussed in depth, so that's when we'll find out what has happened and why there may have been a drop."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Can I just ask about the timing of that? Because if you already know that there's a 6 per cent drop, why will it take the best part of a year to\u2014well, November's only next month, to be fair, now, but why will it take that length of time to establish why there's a drop? You'd have thought if you'd seen a trend like that\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Obviously, they meet at certain times and they will assess what's happened. That seems quite normal to me."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, but we'll get a note on that, is it? It's just that they knew this six months ago."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "In November, we'll have more information about this, so we can let you have information about that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "That would be really helpful, just for\u2014. I'm sure constituents in Denbighshire will want to know about that. And then finally from me, Chair, if I may, Flying Start beneficiaries\u2014it's got a specific explanation of what a Flying Start beneficiary is, but I think, particularly in view of the evidence we've heard on this committee about parental support in connection with the removal of the defence of reasonable chastisement, for example, this committee is very concerned about what's out there in terms of parental support. Eighteen per cent of Flying Start beneficiaries have parents attending the informal parenting courses; that's 18 per cent, that's not very high. Any idea about what you might be able to do to encourage take-up or is that very locally decided?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "If I can add to that, obviously, somebody only has to attend one course\u2014we've got no way of knowing whether parents are completing the whole of a course, really."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Obviously, the offer is there for parents to take up the parenting courses, and there are four elements to Flying Start, and maybe some of the parents don't feel that they want to or need to. I don't think we've got any more evidence on that for take-up\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, the reach of this is going to be important, because we need the reassurance on the back of the legislation that is going through at the moment."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Absolutely, yes."}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "Parenting courses are, of course, one aspect of parenting support, but not the only one, and they'll be appropriate for a lot of parents, but for some not. What all parents do get at an enhanced level in Flying Start is the support of the health visitor, so the health visitor is, in effect, providing a significant amount of support for parenting. Now, that can be practical things like weaning or potty training et cetera, but, actually, it's also about managing a child's behaviour, managing how a parent develops that bonding and that attachment with their child. So, the role of the health visitor in supporting a parent to be a parent is absolutely critical, and every parent in Flying Start areas will be getting that enhanced level of support. Of course, it's not just in Flying Start areas now, because with the Healthy Child Wales programme, the universal programme of health visiting visits, we have a much more consistent and standardised set of visits and engagements with parents that cover a lot of these areas. In addition, I'd also add that when parents use the childcare in Flying Start, or childcare generally outside of Flying Start areas, there is often a lot of working between the childcare setting and the parent over parenting\u2014again, managing a child's behaviour, managing any issues that the childcare worker thinks are emerging in terms of whether it's eating or, again, toileting. So, parenting courses are important, but it's really essential that we see those in the broader context of the different ways in which lots of professionals interact with parents, providing them with advice, guidance and support, and actually what works for parents in terms of how they take on board some of that advice and that help. Sometimes a formal course is quite off-putting for parents, but the sort of quiet word, the top tips, the advice that a friendly professional gives can be very, very impactful."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "That's a really helpful answer. It does raise, unfortunately, another question about whether a health visitor in those circumstances might find themselves in a difficult position if they're dealing with a parent who has smacked a child, but we'll leave that for Stage 3."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "We'll be dealing with that, I'm sure."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "But thank you; that was a helpful answer. Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending this morning? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your attendance. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Thank you very much."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Item 4 is papers to note. There's just one today: the letter from the WLGA regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019 in response to our letter asking about the change in approach. Item 5 then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you."}]}

Here we are the first day of June and the government still has yet to address the flaws in its programs; it is still letting so many Canadians down. I have a series of very straightforward and specific questions. On April 20 we raised with the Minister of Finance the issue of companies that had purchased another company not being able to demonstrate revenue loss, and therefore not being eligible for the wage subsidy, even though both companies separately would have been able to do just that.

Along the same lines, we asked on April 8 to allow businesses applying for the wage subsidy to demonstrate their 30% revenue loss using other metrics, such as loss of earnings, subscriptions and orders, in order to qualify.

Right now, there is a $240,000shortfall for about 60student jobs, and the minister has the nerve to tell us that the government has provided more flexibility.

The dairy sector in Canada is made up of more than 220,000 Canadians and foreign workers who dedicate their lives to feed us. While our society lives through unprecedented changes, the dairy sector demonstrates its resilience and proves more than ever the value of the supply management system. It is why we increased by $200 million the borrowing capacity of the Canadian Dairy Commission to improve its butter and cheese storage programs, giving the flexibility to manage the surplus of milk and support its mandate.

These acts don't have to be violent or result in the loss of life to be wrong. In fact, the actions of Amy Cooper shone a light on the stealth racism that exists. We must acknowledge inequities in our institutions and in people's lived experiences. If we as Canadians truly desire an inclusive Canada, every single one of us must step up, be an ally and do what we can to make workplaces, communities and public spaces safer. Our government has started this work. The open, transparent, merit-based appointment process is resulting in decision-making tables better reflecting Canadians. We recognize the UN International Decade for People of African Descent; the applications for capacity building in black Canadian communities are being assessed; the anti-racism secretariat is set up for Canadians but also for government departments to improve their systems, including advancement opportunities; and the recently announced immunity task force will provide disaggregated data to decision-makers because decisions need to be based on science and evidence.

The season opened last week, and fishers are desperate for support. For indigenous fishers, fishing sustains their communities. It is their way of life. Will the government work with the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation and inland fishers to develop and facilitate the delivery of an emergency package that works for them and find ways to redirect product to domestic markets, including communities facing food insecurity now?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bernadette Jordan", "content": "Mr. Chair, we've recognized how hard the pandemic has hit our fishers and our fishing sector. We've made available a number of different measures. One of the things we're doing primarily is the harvesters' benefit, which allows all harvesters to take advantage of a benefit as well as a grant contribution to help them get through. We're also changing EI so they can now qualify for their EI benefits based on previous seasons, not this one, recognizing they're going to face challenges this year. The Freshwater Fish Marketing Board is a Crown corporation. We know it's been a very difficult time for them. We are continuing to look at ways we can address the challenges within the industry and we'll continue to work with them to make sure we are addressing those needs."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "Ms. Ashton, we have about one minute left. There's time for a short question. Go ahead."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Niki Ashton", "content": "My question is to the Minister of Transport. Canadians are being ripped off by airlines that are refusing to give passengers their money back. Airlines are profiting off Canadians during a very desperate time. This government has sat by while the Canadian Transportation Agency issued a statement to back up the airlines' appalling actions. What is this government doing to fix this? Why aren't they ensuring that public funds involve reimbursing passengers and an equity stake for Canadians?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Marc Garneau", "content": "Mr. Chair, I certainly recognize the very difficult situation and the frustration of Canadians who would have preferred a refund. At the same time, at this point if airlines were required to immediately reimburse all the cancelled tickets, it would have a devastating effect on the airlines. That is why the Canadian Transportation Agency, which is an independent body, recommended that vouchers be issued and that they have a reasonable time to be usedtwo years. It is also very important to bear in mind that as we begin to exit this pandemic, we must still have an airline industry in this country."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "Now we're going to the honourable member for Victoria, Ms. Collins. Please go ahead."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Laurel Collins (Victoria, NDP)", "content": "Mr. Chair, in Victoria housing and homelessness were at a crisis point long before the pandemic hit, but now people are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. If you don't have a place to live, you don't have the luxury of following public health advice and staying home. As part of the recovery, will this government be increasing funding to build or buy the housing needed to address homelessness?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Ahmed Hussen", "content": "Mr. Chair, very early in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our government provided $157.5 million directly to 51 community entities to respond directly to the needs of homeless Canadians. We also provided $50 million in additional money to women's shelters. We are continuing with the national housing strategy. We are providing supports to communities and NGOs, as well as municipalities that are moving projects forward."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Laurel Collins", "content": "Mr. Chair, the federal government allocated just $1.3 million in Reaching Home funds to my region.

Is the government going to show some leadership and at least match the provincial funds?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Ahmed Hussen", "content": "Mr. Chair, we moved very quickly. The $157.5 million, I must note, was additional money on top of the base funding that we provide every year to address the needs of Canada's most vulnerable.

Regardless of the COVID-19 pandemic, the last time I checked, we still had a democratic system and the government had to remain accountable. The government needs to present a picture of the economic situation and a picture of its overall emergency measures. Does the government intend to extend the measures over the summer? If so, how will it do so? The government must also present its working scenarios for the economic recovery. The government needs to be transparent. When will the government provide its economic update?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr.Chair, I would like to thank the hon. member for his questions. I agree, it is very important to be transparent and to provide the necessary information to Canadians. Every day, we announce measures, of course, but also the cost of the measures and the amount of the investments. It is very important. The challenge at the moment is the economic situation, which is very fluid. When the situation is more stable, we will have the opportunity to give an economic update."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie", "content": "In my opinion, Mr.Chair, it will really be too late to do the economic update when things are more stable. We have been asking for an economic update for the past month. Even the Parliamentary Budget Officer has been urging the government to table an economic update in a timely manner. With only three weeks left in the House before the summer, the clock is ticking. The Quebec government will table its economic update later this month. Will the federal government follow suit?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr.Chair, let me confirm that we will continue to be transparent about the investments; it is very important. Of course, each day we work to make sure we have a solid grasp of the economic situation. As I said, when the situation is a little more stable, we will have the opportunity to explain our situation with an economic update."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie", "content": "Once again, Mr.Chair, when the situation is more stable, it will be too late to do an economic update; instead we will have to table a budget with the recovery in mind. Speaking of the recovery, the Parliamentary Budget Officer is surprised that the government is calling on the private sector for ideas for its recovery plan. Mr.Giroux points out that this government has thousands of public servants with very good ideas, and he adds that the government can also ask for the opposition parties' views. That would be a very good idea. Why is the government contracting out the development of its recovery plan to the private sector?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr.Chair, I would like to tell the hon. member that it is important to listen to what we are trying to do, and to listen to people's ideas and opinions, not only in Parliament, but also from our society. So we keep listening. Of course, with our approach, we will address the economic recovery in a way that will ensure we can maintain our very strong position."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie", "content": "Mr.Chair, we are still surprised that the government has contracted out its recovery plan to the private sector. The sooner the government tables its recovery plan, the better. Businesses and individuals would start gaining confidence in the economy again. It would help them to loosen the purse strings and be assured that there will be economic life after the pandemic. Again, that is what the Parliamentary Budget Officer says. Can the government tell us when it will table its recovery plan?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr.Chair, we feel it is very important to consider what we need to do in each phase of our recovery. At this time, it is necessary to consider the public health situation and the gradual reopening of our economy. That is why we feel our approach aims for a safe recovery. Obviously, by gathering more information in Phase3, we will be able to consider more than one approach to recovery."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "Mr.Ste-Marie, you have about 30seconds left."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie", "content": "Thank you.

Ed Fast (Abbotsford, CPC)", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chair. The Prime Minister continues to pander to the Communist regime in China. We were shocked to hear that his own Minister of Digital Government used WeChat, a Chinese social media site, to raise funds to sue a Global News reporterfor what? It was for daring to expose China's attempt to hoard PPE during the COVID crisis. Is it the practice of the government to support lawsuits against Canadian reporters who challenge the hostile actions of the regime in China, and will the Prime Minister now condemn the actions of the digital government minister?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Steven Guilbeault", "content": "Mr. Chair, we value the important work of media across the country and the world. Attacking the integrity of hard-working journalists is not acceptable. As many members on all sides of the House know, WeChat is a social media platform used to engage and share information with the Chinese-Canadian community.

Two and a half years ago, the Prime Minister travelled to China to commence free trade negotiations, and the talks ended up in complete failure and embarrassment. Still the Prime Minister continues to cozy up to the Chinese regime, refusing to ban Huawei from our 5G network or to speak out convincingly against China's oppression in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the two Michaels are continuing to languish in Chinese jails. This is the kind of partner the Prime Minister wants to negotiate a trade agreement with.

Mary Ng", "content": "Mr. Chair, I thank the honourable member for the question. The answer is no."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Ed Fast", "content": "Mr. Chair, I just want to make sure. Free trade is a good thing when it takes place between like-minded countries that embrace free market principles and apply the rule of law. China is not such a country. In fact, China repeatedly flouts international trade rules, illegally dumps underpriced goods into Canada, and prevents Canadian canola, beef and pork from entering China. Is has also jailed Canadians without due process. Will the minister now assure us that our government will not negotiate any free trade agreements with China, yes or no?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Mary Ng", "content": "We are not in discussions with China on a free trade agreement, and as my colleagues, including the Prime Minister and the foreign minister, have said many times in this House and outside of this House, our priority continues to be the immediate release of Canadians detained in China.

Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee this morning. We've received no apologies for absence. Can I ask if there are any declarations of interest from Members, please? No. Okay, thank you. Item 2 this morning is the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill: Stage 2 proceedings. I'm pleased to welcome Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Karen Cornish, deputy director, children and families division at Welsh Government; and Emma Gammon, lawyer for Welsh Government. Thank you for attending this morning and welcome to the committee. I'm just going to run through the procedures that we're going to follow now. As I said, the purpose of the meeting is to undertake Stage 2 proceedings on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. For these proceedings, Members should have copies of the marshalled list of amendments, the groupings of the amendments for debate and the voting order for the amendments. The marshalled list of amendments is the list of all amendments tabled, marshalled into the order in which the sections appear in the Bill. The order in which we consider amendments will be the default order\u2014that is, sections 1 to 3 and the long title. You will see from the groupings list that amendments have been grouped to facilitate debate. However, the order in which they're called and moved for decision is dictated by the marshalled list. Members will, therefore, need to follow the two papers, although I will advise Members when I call them whether they're being called to speak in the debate or to move their amendments for a decision. There will be one debate on each group of amendments. Members who wish to speak in a particular group should indicate to me in the usual way. I will call the Deputy Minister to speak on each group. For the record, in accordance with the convention agreed by the Business Committee, as Chair I will move amendments in the name of the Deputy Minister. For expediency, I will assume that the Deputy Minister wishes me to move all of her amendments, and I will do so at the appropriate place in the marshalled list. Deputy Minister, if you do not want a particular amendment to be moved, please indicate to me at the relevant point in proceedings. In line with our usual practice, legal advisers to the committee and the Deputy Minister are not expected to provide advice on the record. If Members wish to seek legal advice during proceedings, please do so by passing a note to the legal adviser and, if necessary, we can adjourn. My intention is to try to dispose of all amendments during today's meeting. I will call a short break in proceedings at an appropriate time, if necessary. Okay, thank you. So, we will proceed, then, to group 1, which is the duty to promote public awareness. The lead amendment in the group is amendment 1 in the name of the Deputy Minister. I move amendment 1 in the Deputy Minister's name and call on the Deputy Minister to speak to her amendment and the other amendments in this group."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Thank you very much, Chair. My amendments 1 and 4 will place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law to ensure that the public are made aware of how the law will change as a result of the defence of reasonable punishment being abolished and that physical punishment would be prohibited once the Act commences. I tabled these amendments in response to this committee's recommendation\u2014this was a recommendation from this committee in the Stage 1 report, so I have responded to that. I've already made a commitment to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over approximately six years from Royal Assent, should the Bill be passed. I've considered amendments 1A to 1E, which have been tabled by Janet Finch-Saunders, and which relate to the duty to raise awareness. Amendment 1A introduces a reference to public understanding. We don't think, actually, that this adds anything to the Government amendment, which already mentions awareness. It makes the awareness-raising duty open-ended with no time limit, which is not necessary. By commencement, messaging around the change in the law will be embedded. The awareness-raising campaign will continue for a number of years. Therefore, an ongoing duty referring specifically to the law change would not be required. I understand, of course, that the awareness-raising campaign needs to be comprehensive, well planned and to reach out to all those people and all those communities who need to be aware of the law change, and understand how to respond to it. But I don't think it's helpful or necessary to highlight specific groups, such as visitors to Wales, on the face of the Bill\u2014that's the approach taken in amendment 1E\u2014as it risks placing too much emphasis on certain groups at the expense of others. In relation to children, the committee will know that I'm fully committed to children\u2019s rights, and that Welsh Ministers are already under a duty to have due regard to the rights of children whenever they exercise their functions. An additional due regard requirement, such as the one set out in amendment 1D, relating specifically to the need to promote awareness among children is not needed. This would be part and parcel of the Welsh Government approach to putting children\u2019s rights at the heart of our policy making. Similarly, I don't think it's necessary for the Bill to set out specifically the topics that need to be covered in the awareness-raising campaign, as is suggested in amendments 1B and 1C. That level of detail, I don't think, is for the face of the Bill. Information required about parenting support will be considered by the parenting expert group, under the auspices of the Bill\u2019s strategic implementation group, working with my officials and the expert stakeholder group on the awareness-raising campaign. And, really, their thinking should not be constrained in any way by specifications on the face of the Bill. I think we always need to bear in mind that what the Bill does is remove a defence to an existing criminal offence; it does not create a new offence. And in this context, it doesn't make sense for this Bill to contain a provision requiring the provision of information about how a person may raise concerns if it appears to them that a child is being physically punished. As I set out in my letter to this committee responding to recommendation 15 on this point, safeguarding is everyone\u2019s business, and, as now, the public have a role in highlighting to relevant services if they are concerned about a child. I'm asking for the support of Members for amendments 1 and 4, and I ask Members to reject amendments 1A to 1E because this would place unnecessary provisions on the face of the Bill."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you, Deputy Minister. Are there other Members who wish to speak? Janet Finch-Saunders."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. I wish to speak to amendments 1A to 1E, which relate to the Deputy Minister's amendment on the duty to promote public awareness. While we believe it is absolutely imperative that the public are made aware of this controversial change in the law, the Deputy Minister's amendment lacks a number of key points that the committee were actually keen to address at Stage 1. An important thread runs throughout each and every amendment that I've tabled within this group\u2014that of a sustained awareness campaign, which not only stretches beyond the implementation of the Bill, but serves as a duty for future administrations. Amendment 1A: primarily, amendment 1A changes amendment 1 to include the promotion of understanding changes to the law. I don't think it's enough for the Welsh Government to say that the public should be made aware of the coming into force of section 1 and that a public awareness campaign needs to be sustained until the Welsh Government's objectives have been achieved. Despite the fact that it is intended to change behaviour, the consequences of this law are far greater than that of organ donation or prohibiting smoking indoors. Instead of an opt-out system or a civil offence, this law will remove a defence for parents, information on which could be there on their records for the rest of their lives, potentially separate parents, and could affect employment chances. As such, whilst we agree with the necessity of the awareness campaign, it is important too that the Welsh Government take stock and ensures that parents are not penalised due to a weak awareness campaign. The witnesses we heard before this committee also noted the necessity of ensuring that the public understands\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Janet, Dawn is asking if you'll take an intervention."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "I just wanted to know\u2014could you give us examples of any other piece of legislation where there's been indefinite public awareness campaigns once it's been passed?"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "There's a lot of legislation.

Even today, as I sit here, the public are not aware of many of those pieces of legislation. This particular piece of legislation will have a profound effect on the parenting of children in Wales. So, therefore, I think there is a necessity for both children and parents to become involved, and I shall speak now\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "With respect, Chair, that's not the question I asked."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "\u2014to my amendments."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "I can call you in the debate, if you'd like to make a more substantive contribution on this.

And that's what we're talking about here, Members\u2014the implications of removing this defence. Strikingly, the Office of Police and Crime Commissioner for Gwent stated the following: 'the potential for public resistance to the Bill through misunderstanding or confusion over it implications may pose the largest barrier to its implementation.' If you are intent on removing the defence of reasonable punishment, it is therefore not unreasonable to ensure that law-abiding parents fully understand the ramifications of this Bill. Additionally, the committee found that while the current Welsh Government's intention to deliver a public awareness campaign was beyond doubt, future Governments may have less of a commitment. This places further weight on the fact that the Welsh Government should be under a duty to promote awareness and understanding of the Bill beyond its commencement. Furthermore, the Children (Equal Protection from Assault) (Scotland) Bill quite clearly notes that, under section 2, the Scottish Ministers must take such steps as they consider appropriate to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of section 1 on the abolition for the defence of reasonable punishment. Therefore, I would be grateful if the Deputy Minister can respond as to the reasons why the Welsh Government has deviated from this course of action in their amendment.

I can call you in the debate, Hefin."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Should our amendment to be agreed, we also request that a printing change be made to ensure that the new heading reflects promoting awareness of the changes to the law made by section 1. Amendment 1B: amendment 1B is in line with the committee's recommendation 9, which stated that, as part of a public awareness campaign, there should be details about the support available to parents to use alternatives to physical punishment when disciplining their children. During evidence at Stage 1, the witnesses we saw before the committee raised serious concerns about harder-to-reach groups who needed to be made aware of removing the defence. For example, Children in Wales, Action for Children and Play Wales stated that some families and communities may be harder to reach with information and support. Welsh Government needs to make sure that they receive the information they need. Now, while the Deputy Minister states that she would work hard to ensure that harder-to-reach groups receive this information, a duty to provide information on alternatives to physical punishment would ensure that future Welsh Governments would maintain a successful awareness-raising campaign. I note the Deputy Minister accepted the recommendation, through our amendment, but this does not explicitly include a duty to provide details about support for parents. As will be expanded upon later, the Deputy Minister has relied upon the 'Parenting: Give it Time' campaign to be delivered alongside awareness raising. However, this is only an online resource and she must be clear about what other avenues will be available to parents who do not have access to the internet or are part of harder-to-reach groups. Amendment 1C: amendment 1C supports the committee's recommendation 15 that explains that the Welsh Government should ensure clear advice is provided on what people can do if they have seen or learned of a child being physically assaulted. We urged, at Stage 1, that although many professionals were already under a duty to report concerns about physical punishment, regardless of the Bill, other witnesses raised concerns that it could create the potential for claims of abuse that are unfounded. In particular, some were worried that children, who may not realise the implications of reporting, could make allegations that are actually untrue. While we would expect the awareness-raising campaign to include the consequences of false accusations, this could also be reflected among adults, if the public are not sufficiently made aware of how they can report and in what situations they can report a case of assault."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. I've got several speakers. I've got Suzy Davies first, then Dawn Bowden."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you very much, Chair. Thank you Minister, and thank you, Janet, for that. I think it's worth just pointing out at this stage that the majority of the amendments that are being made and articulated by Janet there are based on committee recommendations, and those recommendations were made after taking evidence from the public at large, but also you as well. So, that suggests that, at that stage, we weren't reassured by the offer that you were making because we felt the need to put these recommendations into our report. Now, I recognise that you've moved some way on some of these amendments, and we'll been talking about that through the course of the debates on other groups. But the one thing to bear in mind here is this is legislation, now\u2014that means that this is the instrument of the Assembly, not of Government, and if this Assembly feels that the face of the Bill is unclear on the minimum requirements of a public awareness campaign, then we have the right to suggest the things that we would like to see in that public awareness-raising campaign. The list that Janet has given is a minimum. The reason these have been tabled individually and independently is that some may be acceptable where others may not be, so it will be disappointing to hear that you're rejecting them all, and the reason they need to go on the face of the Bill is that, if you are going to introduce specifics via regulation, at the moment we have no reassurance about how you're going to do that\u2014about what input the Assembly, on behalf of our constituents, could have in designing that public awareness-raising campaign. Unless you accept some amendments in other groups, that is the position with this Bill: the influence of the Assembly will be zero over the content of an awareness-raising campaign. In terms of it being non-time limited, I think the amendment has been tabled in the way it has not to oblige you to an everlasting, never-ending campaign of awareness raising. But if you bear in mind that, seven years after the introduction of this Bill, there's going to be some reporting on the effectiveness of the Bill, what is the point of doing that if you don't then have an obligation, should the reports require it to be necessary, to continue promoting the changes in the law? I accept that that can't go on for centuries, but to actually limit it to two years on an issue that is so sensitive, and which has a reach beyond our boundaries, I think is genuinely a mistake. Finally, you mention that safeguarding is everyone's business. I think that's true, but I think Janet Finch-Saunders was right to say that members of the public, ordinary individuals, not professionals, will need assurance that they're doing the right thing. The amendment as listed is not even there to encourage people to do that, although that can be read in that way, but it is to help them be certain that they are doing the right thing. If this is going to be up to the individual, as you've said, and the committee itself wasn't reassured that individuals would know what to do, perhaps I can ask you to consider at Stage 3, if you're going to reject this amendment, how you can reassure members of the public that, if they are going to intervene on the back of this law, they're making things better, not worse."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you, Suzy. Dawn."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "My comments, really, relate to ongoing awareness-raising campaigns, which I think all of us would want to see, and would appreciate in any changes in legislation. My point, really, is that we have a plethora of legislation that this Assembly has passed in the last 20 years, and I'm not aware of any legislation where, on the face of the Bill we have ongoing awareness-raising campaigns on an indefinite basis. It seems to me that, for some reason, you seem to be wanting to take a completely different approach to this piece of legislation. From what the Deputy Minister is saying\u2014and perhaps I will get some clarity on this\u2014there will be an amendment to the legislation that will say that we have an awareness campaign. That awareness campaign can be the subject of consultation with interested parties in terms of what needs to be included in it. It could also, I assume, Deputy Minister, be an awareness campaign that can be written into a set of guidance for future use. But the point I'm trying to make is that I don't believe that any piece of legislation requires ongoing and indefinite awareness-raising campaigns, and particularly in relation to visitors to Wales. Again, we have other pieces of legislation in Wales that are not applicable in the other parts of the UK. I am not aware that there is a necessity for awareness-raising campaigns with visitors coming into Wales on the raft of the other pieces of legislation that we have that they don't. And similarly, when we go to visit countries that have different legislation, we don't necessarily know what legislation we're going into when we visit that country\u2014you just go there and you accept that you go to a different country and you abide by their laws. So, my key point, Chair, is just the necessity of an ongoing, endless awareness campaign being written onto the face of the Bill."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you, Dawn.

But at this point in time, we're talking about amendments 1D and 1E, and particularly in relation to 1D and 1E it just isn't necessary, given the fact that\u2014I won't call it a concession, because I think you made a reasonable point about the Minister making a statement at Stage 3, and I think Dawn Bowden actually supported that as well. That, therefore, makes those amendments unnecessary. Given that, in these circumstances, it is unnecessary to bind Ministers in future Parliaments.

In terms of amendment 1B, I do have sympathy with what is being said here, but I believe that any kind of information or campaign in terms of enabling parents to learn about alternatives to physical punishment should be the subject of continual far-reaching work by the Government, through various programmes, and it should not be an addition on the face of this Bill, which deals with a small change to the common law. And then, on 1D also, if I may\u2014I don't agree with this either.

I'm very grateful for and appreciate the committee's interest and the work that you've done in this area of work. But I do think that these amendments are unnecessary. If we go through them, amendment 1A is really open-ended on promoting public awareness. We're committed to a high-intensity awareness over six years from Royal Assent, and there is an expert stakeholder group supporting us with the development of the awareness campaign. All the points that you've been making will be being considered by that group. I think the level of detail on the face of the Bill is not needed."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay.

So, I don't think that's needed, amendment 1A. Amendment 1B, about support available to parents and how to access it\u2014again, this level of detail is not required on the face of the Bill. I just want to emphasise we have got this expert implementation group, who are working on all aspects of this Bill, many of whom represent organisations who gave evidence to this committee. The Bill is a simple one, with a clear purpose. It aims to remove the defence of reasonable punishment. I think lots of these amendments are very helpful and interesting, but would be discussed and would be acted on in the normal pathway of planning and development, and they're not required on the face of the Bill. So, I'm not putting them down, I'm just saying that we don't need them to be there on the face of the Bill. And then amendment 1C\u2014the information about how to raise concerns\u2014I do repeat that safeguarding is everybody's business, and the same issues apply now as will after this defence has been removed. Amendment 1D\u2014Ministers to have regard to the need to promote awareness among children\u2014now, children's rights are absolutely enshrined in our policy making, and the entire Bill is about protecting the rights of children. So, it is unnecessary duplication. So, we hope that the Bill will remain focused. Again, in terms of visitors, the level of detail is simply not required on the face of the Bill. Our awareness-raising campaign will be comprehensive. And then to pick up a few of the other points that were raised, revisions to the impact assessments are being considered as part of my commitment to update the explanatory memorandum ahead of Stage 3. So, there will be more details on the regulatory impact assessment. The issue that was raised about the Scottish Bill, that it refers to 'understanding'\u2014now, the Scottish Bill was not a Government Bill, it was a private Member's Bill, and our view is that nothing is added by adding the 'understanding'; 'awareness' is sufficient. So, basically, I think that the points made have been very useful, but I urge committee members to accept my amendments, but to reject those proposed by Janet Finch-Saunders, as they are unnecessary provisions in terms of what the awareness-raising duty needs to achieve."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you, Deputy Minister.

I move amendment 2 in the Deputy Minister's name, and call on the Deputy Minister to speak to her amendments, and the other amendments in this group."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. The amendments in this group are to do with the post-implementation review of the Bill, and I believe there was also a committee recommendation to this end from your committee, so you strongly influenced this amendment. It's clear from Members' contributions to this group and recommendations by the committee at Stage 1 that they share my commitment to the importance of post-implementation review of the effect of the abolition of the defence of reasonable punishment. I've already provided assurance that I agree with the importance placed on such a review, both in the explanatory memorandum and during Stage 1 scrutiny. I also made a commitment to bring forward a Government amendment to put a duty to undertake a post-implementation review on the face of the Bill. I have done this with amendment 2. Amendment 5 sets out that this provision will come into force the day after Royal Assent. As I said in my responses to the Stage 1 committee report, and as set out in the explanatory memorandum, the post-implementation review of this Bill will not be a single piece of work, but a continuous programme of work during the years following the commencement of section 1. Firstly, we will continue to conduct attitudinal surveys, which will be used to track changes in attitude towards the physical punishment of children and prevalence of parents reporting that they use physical punishment. The surveys will also be used to monitor the effectiveness of our awareness-raising campaign. Secondly, through a dedicated task and finish group, we are working with organisations to put in place arrangements to establish robust methods for capturing meaningful data relating to the Bill and to consider the possible impact on services. Turning to amendment 2C, this amendment would require Welsh Ministers to prepare and lay before the Assembly a report on the effect of their promotion of public awareness before section 1 is commenced. This amendment is unnecessary and is in conflict with what I think is a priority for the implementation of this Bill: that is, given certainty on the commencement date and in enabling us to work towards this with our partners and stakeholders. I also think this amendment is not required because, as I've already stated, we are preparing to assess the effectiveness of our awareness raising. In June, I shared the findings of a representative survey, which establishes a baseline on public awareness and opinion towards physical punishment of children and the proposed legislation. I shared this with the committee."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you, Deputy Minister. I open it up for discussion now, then. Janet Finch-Saunders."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. I speak to amendments 2C, excluding 2D, to 2K, which relate to the Deputy Minister's amendment 2 on preparing a published report on the effect of abolishing the defence of reasonable punishment. Again, I must stress the importance of getting this right due to the controversial and long-lasting effects of removing the defence of reasonable punishment. Amendments 2E to 2K outline what we would expect to be within this report, and we would wish to see a commitment from the Deputy Minister to ensure the National Assembly for Wales is fully apprised and able to scrutinise the result of this report. Amendment 2C requests that the Welsh Government prepare a report on the awareness-raising campaign and lays it before the Assembly before section 1 commences. As I have outlined under my amendments in group 1, the understanding of the public about the implications of the Bill cannot be sidelined. Although the Deputy Minister has repeated her commitment to a public awareness campaign, we, as the National Assembly for Wales, must be able to scrutinise its effectiveness before section 1 begins. As I noted under amendments 1B to 1E, there are specific groups of people who need to be evaluated on their understanding of the Bill's effect. I'm sure that the Deputy Minister will agree that the harder-to-reach groups are undoubtedly the most vulnerable to any negative impacts that the Bill will have because of the greater potential of a lack of awareness. It is, therefore, important for the Assembly to be able to determine whether the awareness-raising campaign has had a positive effect on these groups of people. As will also be elaborated under amendment 2D, it is extremely important that we, as the Parliament of Wales, are fully apprised of the awareness-raising campaign's impact. Before we implement what will be a criminal offence, it is vital that we ensure that those affected are not adversely impacted because of a poorly targeted awareness campaign. Therefore, I would be grateful if the Deputy Minister would commit to an independent evaluation of the awareness campaign's effects before section 1 commences."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you, Janet. Suzy Davies."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. Deputy Minister, first of all, can I just say thank you for your opening remarks about the possibility of perhaps doing some work around amendment 2B? I'll come to that a little bit later, if I may. I just want to begin by commenting briefly on what you said about why you'll be rejecting amendment 2C here. I actually don't think that this amendment should affect or jeopardise the commencement date in any way at all. It's an operational requirement to get this work done before the commencement date that's in the draft Bill at the moment. So, failing to meet that would be as a result of operations not going well, rather than anything intrinsic in the Bill, so I'm not sure I can accept your argument on that. And, on 2D\u2014very pleased to hear that you'd be willing to introduce something about 'laying' rather than 'publishing' at Stage 3, but, in the spirit of recognising that this is the legislature, perhaps I could encourage you just to accept the amendment at this stage, because it doesn't make any difference. Your amendment is going to pass, and this amendment to it would be\u2014I think the gesture there would be very much appreciated. I'll be speaking mainly to amendments 2A and 2B, but I want to begin, again, by thanking you for moving some way on this and considering amendments to the Bill on the issue of reporting, because I know you were keen to avoid amendments in the name of simplicity; you mentioned it earlier. But this is not a newid bychan, I'm afraid, Si\u00e2n; the terms and the effect of this Bill are quite extensive, and it does need the reassurances, if you like, necessary to mitigate potentially disproportionate effects of this Bill on families where parents' actions had been lawful up until this point in statute. It does need statutory underpinning. So, I am grateful to you for accepting this duty. I know that you're sincere that you want this duty to report to show that the Bill is effective in stopping smacking as a punishment, and also that it is not as harmful to parents as perhaps some of us fear. But, if this were me bringing forward this Bill, I think I'd want to show the world that I was doing the right thing a lot sooner than you appear to wish to do. Amendment 2 means that the efficacy of the Bill will not formally be assessed until seven years after it has passed. There are Acts on the statute book that have lasted a lot less time than that. If you're relying on the two-year period before section 1 comes into operation to do much of the heavy lifting on the culture change, and I think that is what you're expecting\u2014you know, showing a reduction in the incidence of physical punishment, reducing the number of, and indeed the likelihood of, parents putting themselves in the path of criminal liability once those two years are up\u2014I really would have thought you'd want people to know sooner, or as soon as the first possible opportunity on that. Waiting five years, I think, will diminish the ability of you to prove the efficacy of those initial two years, and this is why I'm grateful to you for your offer, because there may be a way where we can overcome that. If the trend of culture change is continuing after year 3\u2014so, basically, in the first year after section 1 comes into effect\u2014that's great, but there's a possibility it's going to reverse. Again, I don't think I'd want to wait five years to find that out. For myself, I think one year would probably be enough, but I think three years is a reasonable compromise, as opposed to five years, for a reporting period. I think seven years is just way too long for a formal evaluation of a Bill's effectiveness. I can't see the reason for quite that length of time\u2014I know you've talked about New Zealand\u2014but neither can the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee. I think that's worth pointing out. When they took the step of recommending this duty to evaluate and report, they also took the step of suggesting a three-year reporting period being more in keeping with other post-legislative scrutiny. That's something I think we perhaps need to bear in mind now, as we enter this period of the consolidation of law. Five/seven years is really something of an outlier, and while that might have been appropriate, perhaps, in New Zealand, I don't think that fits in with our timetables generally here in Wales, and, of course, there are other countries that have introduced this over a period of years, and I note that you haven't drawn on them in order to support your argument. So, can I urge Members and the Minister to consider the arguments behind these amendments? I don't think it's going to reassure anyone\u2014you may want to intervene at this point, Hefin\u2014that we not only won't hear in this Assembly, we won't hear in the next Assembly, about the formal evaluation of this, unless I follow\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I won't intervene; I'll speak."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Is that okay?"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Yes, I'll make the point."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, I've got\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, I'll take the intervention."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "No,\u00a0he doesn't want to make an intervention\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I won't do an intervention; I'll speak."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "\u2014he'll make a contribution."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Oh, apologies\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Just to say\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I'll wait."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Well, let me put the intervention\u2014. I'll do it as an intervention, then. I just feel that\u2014I take your point, and I was expecting it. The point I was making about 1D and 1E is they close down choices to Ministers in future Assemblies. An evaluative practice would actually open up those choices and give future Parliaments more options with regard to this Bill, so I think it's entirely consistent. I don't think the Minister, in putting in amendment 2, was trying to undermine my argument. Actually, I think she's being constructive by doing that, and I think amendment 2 is a practical amendment that's quite helpful, and its consequence will be to open up choices to future Parliaments, whereas my objection to 1D and 1E is they close those down."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, well, as I say, I think, actually,\u00a0the Deputy Minister's offer of a three-year interim period might be part of a resolution to this. Because I'm not 100 per cent sure I accept your argument, either, because it closes it down for the interim period if we don't move on with the Deputy Minister's suggestion\u2014which I'll talk about now, actually. Because I am tempted to accept your offer. It absolutely makes sense and it's clearly made with the best good faith here. But I need some clarity on what you would allow this Assembly to do in helping define the terms of that interim report. Because you've been very clear that you don't want to accept the things that Janet Finch-Saunders has been talking about in a final report, and yet I can tell you we want to hear about these things. So, if you're in a position where you can give a commitment at Stage 3 not only to introduce an interim report, but that you will consult with, perhaps, this committee\u2014I'll leave it to you\u2014on the contents of that interim report, what we would want to see tested, then I'll be minded not to move amendment 2B. If you can't give me that reassurance, then I'm going to move it anyway and we'll return to it at Stage 3, if you don't mind. Just a final point on this issue of reporting within three months rather than as soon as practicable, and I do take your point that there may be a misalignment with reporting periods from the organisations you hope to talk to. Again, at Stage 3, I'm happy if you want to make three months six months, or something like that, but 'as soon as practicable' is open ended, and what you think is practicable may be very different from what I or my constituents think is practicable. So, I don't want to stick with what is practicable; I would like you to put a date on this. If it's a case that you think six months is long enough for data gathering and reporting from third parties, I think that's fairly reasonable as well, but I'm not minded to allow you to just keep this open ended.

I am interested in what Suzy is saying, and have a lot of sympathy with trying to tie it down to specific time periods, and not say 'when it will be practicable'.

Well, just to go on to cover some of the points that have been raised, on the issue of training now, I think Janet raised a number of points about training, and we do have an operations, procedures, processes and training task and finish group as part of our implementation work, and they are considering guidance and training requirements. There are many professional bodies represented on that group, many of whom I think have given evidence here today, and they've really got a chance to have their say. The officials are also looking at training as part of the revision of the explanatory memorandum at Stage 3, so there will be more information about training there. But we have this group looking at it, and it is very key. Generally, I think that all the contributions are very helpful, and I know they're meant in the spirit of trying to improve the legislation. I can't support amendments 2A, 2C, and amendments 2E to 2K, because these amendments make little difference in terms of practical effect to what we have in the Bill already, or they're covered by the Government amendments that I've moved. But I do hope the committee is reassured that we are committed to undertaking a very thorough, multifaceted review of the impact of the legislation that includes tracking public attitudes and considering impacts on\u00a0public services. Now, tracking the public attitudes will be going along at regular points, so there's no question there of having to wait; we'll be having regular reporting of public attitudes."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Would you take an intervention there, Deputy Minister? Thank you very much. Of course, I appreciate that you will not be supporting these amendments, but can you give us some indication of how many of the areas of interest to us you will be reporting on? So, even if this is not a statutory commitment, what exactly from our list, our wish list here, would you be prepared to include in your evaluation?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, I would actually have thought all of them. All the areas you've raised are very relevant, I think. Obviously, this is not a statutory thing I'm saying, but\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "No, no, and this is not a\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes, but considering those points you've put forward, I think all of them have got a great deal of relevance. We will certainly be reporting to the group to consider any of the ideas that you've suggested and, in particular with the data collection and the monitoring task and finish group, which is about developing methods to collect data, we will be putting forward some of the suggestions that you've made on those issues. So, I don't see any problem with that at all."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "So, as I say, I can't support the amendments. I'm hopeful you may withdraw the two amendments\u2014I think one of yours and it was one of Janet's, wasn't it\u2014so that we could work together on those before the next stage. Because I am sympathetic to your views on these matters, and I think they do reflect some of the discussions in the committee as well. So, I'd be happy to work with you to bring forward the amendments at Stage 3. In line with the recommendations of the Finance Committee, further details of the costs associated with the post-implementation review will be provided in a revised regulatory impact assessment at Stage 3. So, I think at this point I would ask that Members reject the non-Government amendments and agree to my amendments 2 and 5, which will ultimately achieve the same policy aim without the need for unnecessary detail on the Bill, with the exception, obviously, of those two amendments, which I'm prepared to look at a way of moving forward on."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay.

Members will note that I've brought forward an amendment to provide certainty on the date of commencement of the core provision in the Bill, which is obviously to abolish the defence of reasonable punishment. And that is going to be debated under group 5. So, we're obviously debating that after we deal with these particular technical issues\u2014these are technical issues here, basically. As a consequence of proposing to remove the power for a Welsh Minister to make an Order for commencement, the power to make transitory, transitional or saving provisions in connection with section 1 of the Bill coming into force would also be removed. So, I'm not seeking here to add any new powers to the Bill; amendment 3 will simply add this existing power back onto the face of the Bill where amendments 7 and 8 remove it, and amendment 6 will bring the power into force the day after Royal Assent. In fact, removing the power for the Welsh Ministers to commence the provision in section 1 by Order means the statutory instrument will actually do less than originally intended. These amendments are technical in nature and while I acknowledge that the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee raised the issue of what procedure should be applied, their report did not call for any change to no procedure being applied. The absence of an Assembly procedure does not mean that Ministers' decisions in relation to transitional powers cannot be scrutinised by the Assembly. Any concerns about the Welsh Ministers' proposals could be put to me in the Senedd. This was a point made to CLAC and, as I say, their final conclusion was that no procedure is the appropriate procedure for such a power. For those reasons, I encourage Members to reject amendment 3A from Suzy."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Suzy Davies."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you very much. Well perhaps, Deputy Minister, I can begin by saying that one person's technical issue is another person's essential part of the legislative procedure and a keen element in scrutiny. But I thank you for noting the Assembly's observations on the ministerial powers granted in this Bill\u2014this time by CLAC, as you say. Moving this\u2014and I'm glad actually that amendment 8, I think it was, has removed an Order provision and we're moving into an area where at least statutory instruments do feature here. I have to say that amendment 3A is something of a probing amendment, and I'll explain why now. Your amendment 3 seeks to give a familiar range of powers in connection with the coming into force of section 1, but it's actually in a substantive part of section 1 itself now\u2014it's not a separate commencement power. And, actually, I've been listening to the rest of this debate, and thinking that, if you're going to be introducing an awareness campaign and a report, the chances are you're going to need some regulatory powers to introduce some of the aspects of both those policy areas, I think. And I'm wondering whether the\u2014what is it\u2014transitory, transitional and saving provisions are actually enough powers for you under the course of this Bill. I'm wondering whether you want to consider actually amending this to give yourself the more usual unrestricted power to make regulations in order for you to get section 1 implemented, bearing in mind that it has now been amended from that original, very short and simple\u2014or at least simple in terms of drafting\u2014initial draft. As I say, in anticipation of you rejecting amendments in group 1 I tabled this, in order to make sure that an opportunity remains for the Assembly to bring anything you may wish to introduce under section 1, when it comes into effect, onto the floor of the Assembly. Because while I completely accept that you've acknowledged that statutory instrument is the process for introducing things from now on, it's still possible to do that without procedure, and so I have no idea whether you think what you introduce would be better suited to be introduced by a negative or affirmative procedure. Amendment 3A is a holding position, which we will return to you in Stage 3, because I think, again, this is an area where it might be valuable for us to discuss quite what kind of powers you're looking for, because I think you probably need something that's beyond transitional, transitory and saving."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay.

We don't actually think it's necessary to have wider powers, but we will keep this under review and at Stage 3, I think that\u2014. When I was looking at this, I was concerned to know what the transitory powers\u2014what we would actually need to do at that stage, but I can understand that there may be links to other Bills in ways that we are not anticipating at the moment that would make it necessary to have those powers. So, basically, I don't think it is necessary to have wider powers, but I can assure you that we'll keep that in review coming up to Stage 3."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Can I just ask a question on the back of that?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Will you take a brief intervention at the end, Minister?"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Will you take the briefest intervention before your full stop?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I was going to end there, yes."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Right, okay, well, just before your full stop, would you just confirm that you're happy for us to discuss this before Stage 3?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes, very happy.

We will move on to group 4, which relates to the duty to ensure sufficient funding. The lead amendment in the group is amendment 11 in the name of Janet Finch-Saunders. I call on Janet Finch-Saunders to move amendment 11 and to speak to her amendments. Janet."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. I speak to both amendments in this group. As I outlined under amendments 2I and 2J, there are ongoing concerns about the potential costs for Welsh devolved authorities and the lack of quantifiable costs within the regulatory impact assessment. Now, it was absolutely clear from evidence that we received in this committee that unknown costs would be challenging and potentially problematic. As I have mentioned previously, these concerns would doubtless be most keenly felt in our hard-pressed social services. Furthermore, the Welsh Local Government Association stated that there must be a commitment that whatever the costs are, those costs are met, because it is legislation that is being led by the National Assembly for Wales. Now, during evidence, the Deputy Minister, when asked about the reliance on a limited number of reporting of cases likely to happen and the potential for a degree of unknown costs stated: 'we are doing our very best to prepare to cover all eventualities that we can anticipate.' But you couldn't commit to a broad figure, instead telling us that: 'we have to rely on what the people who run those organisations are telling us.' And: 'We have to measure it as we go along.' Given that devolved authorities need to plan their budgets for these changes, we only think it is fair for the Welsh Government to provide sufficient funding to alleviate the cost implications of this Bill. Now, while amendment 11 makes reference to costs borne by local authorities and health boards, I note that amendment 12 takes this further by including other devolved authorities that are not funded by Welsh Government. Anticipating the Deputy Minister's response that few under this category, if any at all, would be affected by the Bill, we are pursuing a principle here, and it is agreement to the principle of providing sufficient funding that we are seeking from you as the Deputy Minister. Now, these are just two examples of Welsh Government legislation to date that have been underfunded. The Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013: last year, the Economy, Infrastructure and Skills Committee found that the Wales annual spend on walking and cycling is half that of England's and one sixth of Holland's. Furthermore, the committee highlighted that the passing of the Act put a requirement on local authorities to continuously improve active travel routes, but were constrained by the funding made available to them. The Minister at the time announced a three-year funding settlement of \u00a360 million. Now, my local authority and other authorities that have done some monitoring on the active travel Act\u2014they simply were not awarded sufficient funding to actually allow the active travel Act to become a meaningful piece of legislation, and the same goes with the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015. This month, the auditor general has raised concerns that the public services boards created under the Act were limited in their work and impact due to the lack of dedicated funding. Outside of the Welsh Government's regional grant that cannot be spent on projects, councils often contribute through officer time or facilities, but resources and capacity to support those PSBs remain a key risk, as partners don't have the capacity to take on more. The reason that I wanted these amendments placed in here is I genuinely do not believe that you've even envisioned what, or even estimated the likely cost to be borne by the organisations, and certainly our local authorities and health boards, the impact this Bill is going to have."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you, Janet. Are there other Members who would like to speak in this group, please? No. Okay. I call the Deputy Minister, then."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. I can understand that the Member is concerned about the impact of this Bill on public services, but you will see from the explanatory memorandum and from the raft of impact statements published with the Bill that we've done a thorough and extremely diligent job of considering the potential impacts of this Bill before introduction. And as far as we're aware, no other country has done more than us to consider the impacts of similar legislation, and also comprehensively prepared for implementation. We've explored the published data, which is available from other countries, on the impact of measures they've taken to prohibit the physical punishment of children. We've also spoken to a range of stakeholders in Ireland, New Zealand and Malta, who have legal systems similar to our own. And in these countries, there is no evidence that public services have been overwhelmed following law reform. And stakeholders have been clear when giving evidence to this committee that they do not consider there will be runaway costs, and I think we should trust their judgment on this. In fact, as this committee notes in its Stage 1 report, those delivering services on the front line have said, without exception, that 'this Bill will improve their ability to protect children living in Wales because it will make the law clear.' Sally Jenkins of the Association of Directors of Social Services said to this committee: 'In terms of thresholds for children\u2019s services, we would not be anticipating a huge number of referrals to us. There may be a small number of referrals that come through. What we know from other nations is that it will peak and then settle. We recognise that\u2019s likely to happen.' That's from the front line. Jane Randall, chair of the National Independent Safeguarding Board Wales, said: 'there's no expectation that there's going to be a huge increase in the number of referrals coming through to local authority social services, I think it would be dealt with within their existing resources.' And Dr Rowena Christmas, Royal College of General Practitioners, said: 'I can't see it's going to lengthen consultations. I can't see that it's going to increase the number of consultations, and I don't think it's going to increase the number of referrals I make to the health visitor or to social services, because if I was worried, I'd make those referrals now regardless of the Bill.' I just want to say again that the Bill is removing a defence to an offence of common assault, which has formed part of the common law of England and Wales for a very long time. And social services already receive and investigate reports of children being assaulted, including from health and education, so it's not a whole new area of costly activity for any of them. I do think that the evidence that you had at your committee did highlight those points. As I've already pointed out when discussing group 2 amendments, we're working with organisations to put in place arrangements to collect data about the possible impact on their services, and this will be analysed as part of the post-implementation review of the legislation. Welsh Government can consider with relevant organisations how best to manage any impact on workloads or resources and any cost implications. I can assure you that work to update the regulatory impact assessment has continued, and I've asked officials to prepare a revised RIA, as recommended at Stage 2, and I expect to share an updated RIA with you in advance of Stage 3. Serious consideration is being given on how to provide more detailed estimates of the unknown costs to public services arising from the Bill, but I think you should be reassured by the evidence that was given, particularly to this committee, from the professionals at the front line. What the amendments are proposing is outside the normal funding arrangements that operate within Government, and it's not clear why, in the context of the evidence heard at Stage I, such provisions are necessary. I'm sure that Members will agree that future Governments need to be able to consider, within the context of the budget-setting process, what the priorities are, and these considerations would need to be made within the context at that time, for example taking into account any issues that there are\u2014UK Government actions, what happens in relation to Brexit, or any other unforeseen impacts on the economy or Welsh society. All those issues would have to be taken into account. Furthermore, as is the case now, the National Assembly for Wales scrutinises the Welsh Government budget annually, so it would be able to make an argument for additional funding for public bodies, should it consider that this is required. I do think all the evidence has shown that we do not anticipate that there will be a huge increase of a demand for funding, so I urge Members to reject these amendments, which I believe are unnecessary."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Chair, could I ask a question?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "You can reply to the debate now, Janet, yes."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "I'd like to ask a question of the Deputy Minister. When we were taking evidence, at an earlier stage, I noticed that part of the stakeholder group\u2014there was some liaison going on with social services departments across Wales. Now, we have 22 local authorities. At that time, the numbers mentioned were quite small\u2014I think only a handful. What discussions have taken place with our local authorities in terms of their social services departments in terms of the lead, the cabinet members, or, indeed, the head of service? I can speak from my own experiences, when going around my constituency, but when I've spoken to some of the family support groups, and, indeed, the departments themselves, they are very concerned about the financial impact that this is going to have on the provision. They're already overstretched, and they see this as another burden\u2014primarily another financial burden. So, how much have you engaged with them?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "There's been extensive engagement. We've had meetings with the Association of Directors of Social Services, and they're represented on all our groups, and we're working very closely with them, because, of course, they represent all the local authorities. But I have to say, when I've been going round and meeting lots of different groups, the first thing they say is, 'I'm so glad that you're doing this', and they haven't mentioned any financial implications. But, obviously, we will be very aware of\u2014we are looking at any more evidence that comes up."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay. So, I'll still move my amendments.

The lead amendment in the group is amendment 9 in the name of Suzy Davies. And I call Suzy Davies to move amendment 9 and to speak to the amendment and the other amendments in the group."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you very much, Chair. Amendment 9 is actually consequential on amendment 10 passing, but it's the lead amendment in the group, so I'll move it to begin the debate. Minister, I'm speaking here now to amendments 10 and 15 specifically. You've said repeatedly, and I believe you, that you do not wish to criminalise parents but just to stop them physically punishing their children. You could have chosen to try and achieve this through awareness raising and civil enforcement, but by choosing to remove the defence to a criminal act you have entered the arena of criminal law, where the logical consequence is opening parents up to liability\u2014not necessarily getting prosecuted, but liability to prosecution, not just liability to civil sanctions. I'm sure you'd prefer parents not to be prosecuted, but that decision does not and cannot lie with you. You, like us, have no agency in this, because the powers and the duties of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service sit outside our competence. You cannot and we cannot, by law or otherwise, instruct either of them in the delivery of your policy intention of not criminalising parents. You've acknowledged to this committee and the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee that revised CPS charging guidance and any other guidance on, for example, out-of-court disposals, are key to delivering your policy objectives. You'll remember how concerned this committee was when we learned that your advisory group\u2014the strategic implementation group, is it\u2014was only in the early stages of discussing what these guidelines might look like. So, you're actually asking us to pass law when we have no control over how parents might be punished for smacking their children\u2014no control of the regard given to the relevance of force, the frequency of the offence, any prior conviction, any prior reporting, not even the views of the child in how they might be sentenced, or thresholds that would be appropriate for cautions and other out-of-court disposals; no guidance to the police on thresholds for arrest, let alone charging. And you argue that the rights of the child are what matter, and I agree with you here, but everybody, adult or child, has a right to natural justice and proportionate remedy or censure, and you are in no position to offer us any comfort on these matters at this stage. Now, CLAC recommended that any revised guidance be made available to AMs before Stage 3. I anticipate that that's unlikely, and I hope I'm wrong, but that's why Janet and I have tabled amendments 10 and 15, which prevent you bringing section 1 into force until that CPS guidance has been fully updated to take into account the change in the law and until pathways away from prosecution have been devised and agreed. That reflects our recommendation 4, this committee's recommendation, as well as CLAC's recommendation 1. It gives your strategic implementation board time to consider how it can get around the other fundamentally worrying issue of the effect of recording reports of apparent physical punishment, even if those reports ultimately prove unfounded. And you have not addressed these in your own amendments. I have to say, Minister, I think these points are so serious that I would have liked to have tabled amendments preventing you seeking Royal Assent for this Bill until the Assembly has seen drafts of the range of official guidance needed for the police and CPS. I'd have sought a Report Stage, if I could, so that we could consider that evidence. But I'm therefore asking you to support the amendments we have tabled, 10 and 15, so that we can bring some damage limitation to a process that you ultimately cannot control once this Bill has passed. Now, I know you've got the numbers to pass this Bill, whether you accept amendments or not, but I just hope you can see the danger in pushing forward with a Bill that changes a person's relationship with the criminal law when you have no legal control over the consequences of that, and you're inviting this Assembly to fall into the same trap. I therefore urge the Assembly to avoid this recklessness by supporting these two amendments."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you, Suzy. Are there other Members who wish to speak? No. Janet, do you want to speak?"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Yes, I wish to speak to amendments 14 and 16. Amendment 14, however, is consequential to amendment 16 passing. Amendment 16 prevents this from commencing until parenting support services have been established by the Welsh Government. As was clear during the committee's evidence sessions, present Welsh Government support programmes for parents have insufficient coverage. For example, the capacity and reach of the Healthy Child Wales programme came under question on its role in awareness raising, with health representatives acknowledging that universality had not been achieved, with 53.2 per cent of children in Wales reported as being contacted. Furthermore, existing parenting support is often only available as part of a targeted programme in specific areas, such as Flying Start, and even the children's commissioner noted that much more is needed to support parents to find alternatives to disciplining their children. Now, the Deputy Minister mentioned the 'Parenting: Give it Time' campaign as part of proposals on a wider package of support for children and their parents. However, the Deputy Minister was challenged on this fact, that this is an online campaign only, and could only respond that the mapping exercise she will undertake. Consequently, it should be remembered that this Bill will affect all parents. Therefore, the Deputy Minister needs to assure the committee and the public that universal support will be provided before the removal of the defence occurs."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you, Janet. Deputy Minister."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. I've listened to what stakeholders and committees have said about the importance of ensuring sufficient time is available prior to the change in the law to abolish the defence of reasonable punishment during Stage 1. As a result, I have brought forward amendments in this group to provide certainty around the date for the change in the law. My amendment 7 will remove the power to commence this core provision of the Bill by Order of the Welsh Ministers and ensure that the defence of reasonable punishment is abolished at the end of a two-year period beginning the day after Royal Assent. That was done to give certainty on the length of time. Up to then, we'd always said 'up to two years'\u2014well, we're giving two years. This certainty will allow key partners, including the police, social services and the Crown Prosecution Service, to plan for changes to guidance, training and data-collection systems more effectively. It'll also provide a focus for our awareness-raising campaign. My amendment 8 in this group has the consequence of removing the power to make transitional provision, which is replaced by my amendments 3 and 6, and we discussed those in the previous group. I've listened to the arguments put forward by Suzy Davies and Janet Finch-Saunders for the amendments in this group that they have tabled. These amendments are all about making the commencement of the Bill conditional on something else happening, whether it's waiting for the revision of Crown Prosecution Service guidance, or the establishment of a pathway for diversion from the criminal justice system, or for the provision of parenting support services. And, really, I don't think that we should be going down that road. As I set out in my letter of response to the Stage 1 report from the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee, we've got good working relations with the CPS through the strategic implementation group, and we work very closely with them. But the CPS are an independent body, as Suzy Davies has said in her contribution, not answerable to Welsh Ministers or this legislature, and it's not appropriate for a Minister or the National Assembly to seek to influence the CPS guidelines. We're discussing the issues with the CPS in the implementation group. And, in fact, I think that these amendments\u2014Suzy's amendments in particular\u2014wouldn't just seek to influence the CPS, but would actually give power to a non-devolved body on the way that we legislate in Wales. So, I don't think we should make it conditional on those guidelines being decided. I think you have to rely on the fact that we have got this very good relationship, very close working relationship. And I know they did give evidence to your committee, I believe, the CPS. And I think legislating to effectively give a non-devolved body a power to commence, or not, Assembly legislation would be highly unusual and would raise great uncertainty, I think, if we did go down that track, because I think this is very important Welsh legislation, which does have broad support across the Assembly. And I don't think we should allow non-devolved bodies to be the final arbiters of commencement of our legislation. So, I don't support those amendments. I think the CPS is entirely independent of Government, and must be entirely independent of Government, and will make its own decisions about how and when it will revise its guidance. In addition, you suggest we allow the UK Government to have a say in when Welsh legislation is commenced in an area that was specifically devolved to the Assembly. The test applied by the proposed amendments as to when commencement could lawfully occur is uncertain. If these amendments passed, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to judge when section 1 could be commenced. This contravenes what stakeholders and committees have asked for, and raises huge uncertainty, which potentially jeopardises the Bill. And I want to assure you again, not only do we have good working relations with the CPS, but also very good working relationships with the police, who are, of course, the other non-devolved body who have great involvement and interest in these issues. The work we do in these groups should not affect the timing of the Bill's commencement. In fact, it's the other way round. My amendment to provide a two-year period between Royal Assent and commencement means these groups can plan their work to a known timescale and deliver in good time before the law comes into force. And then, when it comes to parenting support, the committee knows that I've committed to reviewing the existing provision of parenting support, and work is already under way through the parenting expert group on this very issue. I have already said I will expand the age range of the 'Parenting: Give it Time' campaign, and I think\u2014. I know Janet Finch-Saunders has made the point that it is an online facility. It is very widely used. It is a very successful tool. But, of course, the universal services are also there. For example, the universal service of the health visitors is absolutely crucial, and that is a service that is for every child. And, of course, the health visitors welcome this legislation very strongly. And the expert group is considering what it'll recommend for the future, and it needs the time to be able to do that, to support the Bill as well as to support parenting more widely. So, as I said, I think these are important points that you have raised, but I don't think they are appropriate. So, I therefore urge the committee not to support amendments 9 and 10, nor 13, 14 and 15."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Suzy to reply to the debate."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you very much, and thank you very much, Deputy Minister, as well. I'm disappointed that you haven't seen what's behind Janet Finch-Saunders's final amendment there, actually. Maybe it's something we'll raise again with you at Stage 3, or maybe in the conversations that we have between now and then. But I want to go back to amendments 10 and 15 that I've raised and your assertion that we're giving, or attempting to give, power to the CPS here. We are not. This amendment is drafted very specifically and in full knowledge that we have no legislative competence in this area. And this is why I go back to where my contribution to this started, and it's your choice to try and resolve the problem of\u2014or, sorry, to try and protect children's rights through the medium of a change to the criminal law rather than the many opportunities that were available to you through the civil law and over which you would have had complete competence. This Bill\u2014and, actually, you've said a couple of times in your response today that it's important that it's commenced on a certain date. My argument is: it shouldn't be commenced at all unless you are absolutely certain about how it is likely to affect the parents who will now be captured by the removal of the defence. And, while I claim no mischief on the part of the CPS or the police\u2014obviously I don't\u2014there is nothing you can do that would prevent the CPS, should they wish to do it, or indeed the police with their own guidelines, putting in place something that is wholly disproportionate to the offence that is now being released by the removal of a defence. And, because of that, I ask you to consider, or balance, actually, two important things here: one is the rights of the child, obviously at the forefront of your argument on this, which I would argue could be completely and safely protected through the use of civil law on this occasion; and, actually, the rights of the child again to have a good relationship with parents over whose future they will have no say\u2014or at least you cannot allow them to have any say in how those parents might be treated in terms of sentencing. The relationship between parents and children obviously is different in every family, but that's something you ought to protect in what you're trying to do here, and by leaving it open, as you say, to completely different\u2014sorry, undevolved, two undevolved authorities to make decisions about how that relationship could be affected deeply worries me. I know this isn't going to stop your Bill going forward, but I really want you to consider my arguments and how you might try and address them at Stage 3, because leaving, effectively, the delivery of your policy objectives to somebody over whom you have no control, despite your great relationship with them, should worry us all as a legislature.

Thank you, Chair. Good morning, Deputy Minister. Of those individuals who responded to our written consultation in a personal capacity, nearly 70 per cent do not support this Bill. We also heard a clear message from the parents we met last week who oppose this Bill that, as parents, they understand clearly the difference between child abuse and a light smack from a loving parent. How would you like to respond to that?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Thank you very much, Janet, for that question. I think I'd like to start by saying that child abuse is not the issue that the Bill is trying to address. What the Bill is trying to do is prohibit all forms of physical punishment, and that is in order to protect children's rights and to ensure that children have the same protection from physical punishment as adults. But I do understand that people have different views, and that's why this process has been so important\u2014for us to hear what your views are and what parents' views are. I know that, often, people use different euphemisms really to make light of physical punishment. I've heard expressions used such as a 'light smack' or a 'loving smack' or a 'tap', and really there can be different interpretations of what is a 'light smack', what is a 'loving smack', and that doesn't really cover the issue of the frequency of such actions being taken. But I would say that, however mild it seems to be, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child recognises that any physical punishment of children, however minor, is incompatible with their human rights, and why should a big person hit a little person? That's been the sort of mantra, really, that has taken me through supporting this legislation\u2014that it just seems wrong to me that there is something in the law that could mean that there could be an excuse for that happening. I believe we shouldn't have anything in the law that defends the physical punishment of children, and I don't think we should be defining acceptable ways of hitting or punishing children, because I think it does send a confused message to children. It says, 'It's okay for me to hit you, but don't you hit anybody else.' I think it causes confusion. So, I'm confident that updating the law will make it much clearer for parents and people working with children\u2014and, of course, I'm sure, as you'll have heard from the evidence you've taken, that people who work with children are overwhelmingly in support of this legislation, and the representative surveys that we've carried out show support for the Bill's principles."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you, Deputy Minister. Last week, during the workshop, a few parents\u2014predominantly all of them, actually\u2014said that they use a gentle tap or smacking as part of a toolkit of ways to deal with challenging behaviour or, sometimes, for the safety of the child or, indeed, to carry out the parenting of a child. How do you intend to work with parents going forward, given the finite resources that social care and social services have? I know from the responses we've received to the consultation that parents themselves who have to parent 24 hours a day, seven days a week, they are really, on the scale of things, very upset about this. How do you intend to try and get your message across to those parents on removing what they consider to be part of their toolkit when raising children? How do you intend to deal with that aspect?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, first of all, I want to say, as I've said in most evidence sessions, that I completely accept that bringing up children is hard. It's very difficult; many of us have done it and we know how tough it can be. But we don't think that there is any place for physical punishment in bringing up children. There's a whole range of other ways that you can help parents bring up children, and advice you can give them of different methods to use.

Several consultation responses refer to statistics from Sweden, which they say show that child-on-child violence actually increased by 1,791 per cent between 1984 and 2010, following the ban on physical punishment in 1979. What is your view on these figures and how can we be certain that this Bill won't lead to other long-term negative outcomes in Wales?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, I'm aware of the debate surrounding the interpretation of the different statistics from Sweden. What's happened, really, in the academic research is that different academics are focused on different figures to support their views, and the methodological ways of doing it makes it quite difficult to have causation. I was very encouraged that a recent study of 88 countries concluded that if a country prohibits corporal punishment, the result is association with less youth violence, and this is one of the largest cross-national analyses of youth violence, with more than 400,000 participants. So, there is other evidence, very widespread evidence, which looks at a whole range of people, that is in contrast to the Swedish evidence. But, evidence in this field is mixed and we have considered a wide range of research and reviews, but ultimately the decision is one that is based on our commitment to children's rights."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Do you want question 3?"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "I can do it, yes. The Bill's explanatory memorandum says that 'there is no definitive evidence that \"reasonable\" physical punishment causes negative outcomes for children'. However, we have heard from Equal Protection Network Cymru that international evidence could not be clearer and that they found the Wales Centre for Public Policy's report, on which the explanatory memorandum is based, very confusing and very frustrating, and that it didn't tie in with what they knew. How would you respond to those viewpoints?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "We were very keen to get as balanced research as we possibly could, and we didn't want to just put forward views that we thought agreed with our point of view. So, we were trying to give a balanced point of view, but we did commission the Wales Centre for Public Policy to do an independent literature review and we're honestly reporting to you what they said. But they did make it clear, again, which I think I've said in previous evidence sessions, that all physical punishment, under all conditions, is potentially harmful to children. And certainly, there is no peer-reviewed research that says that physically punishing a child is going to improve things, has favourable outcomes. So, I understand what Equal Protection Network Cymru are saying, because there is a lot of very strong evidence, but we're giving you the evidence that we had from the research that we commissioned."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. We've got some questions now from Suzy on implementation."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. I've just got a couple of questions on this balance between the steps that will be needed to implement this Bill and the impact that it'll actually have. You've probably heard in evidence that we've received that there are still some concerns out there about how agencies might address malicious reporting; some detail about how the public interest test might be applied further along the line; what's going to happen with out-of-hours provision from social services, and so on. There are still, from our perspective, quite a few things that are unknown about the effect on our public services in particular of the implementation of this Bill. Would you agree that perhaps we should know a little bit more about that before we proceed with supporting the Bill?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, it's very difficult, bringing in this legislation that hasn't been done before. It's very difficult to gauge the impact, and we've covered that, I know, in previous discussions. But I think it's very important to say that we are not creating a new offence. The Bill is removing a defence to an offence of common assault. And I think it's an interesting point to make that, in Ireland, they introduced similar legislation through an amendment to a Bill, and had no detailed preparation for bringing in the Bill, and in fact there's no evidence that this has caused any difficulties, and no significant negative impacts or increase in workload. But in any case, we have our implementation group, which is going to address many of these issues. This met on 14 May. That was the first meeting. You see, I think we do have to take a balance between assuming this Bill is going to go through and what we can actually do. We can't presume that the Assembly will accept this Bill, so we have to be staged in what we do. But we had the first strategic implementation group on 14 May, and we had representatives from the police, the police and crime commissioners, the Crown Prosecution Service, the Association of Directors of Social Services Cymru, the Association of Directors of Education in Wales, the Welsh Local Government Association, the legal profession and the third sector. They're all there, and they're all very keen to make this legislation work and to look at the implications of it. I'd just like to say how grateful I am for all those organisations giving their time and commitment. They've set up four work streams, looking at parenting advice and support; data collection, evaluation and monitoring; operations, procedures and processes; and out-of-court disposals and diversions. These groups will be taking forward this work and will be looking at many of those issues that you've mentioned, and will also be updated on the progress of the awareness strategy that we will be bringing in. I'm really confident that the legislation will be implemented in a very practical and workable way, because we do have the commitment of all these agencies, and there's been a huge amount of preparation done in the Welsh Government to prepare for this in a way that, I have to say, hasn't been done in some of the other countries\u2014as I mentioned, in Ireland. So, as much preparation as could be done is being done and has been done, but we really now see that the implementation group is taking forward all these issues, and obviously those agencies that are taking part in the implementation group are, on the whole, in support of the principles of this Bill."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, thank you for that, Minister, but the way I look at this is that you've already said that, if this Bill passes\u2014and it will pass; it's in enough manifestos to pass, so the question is what type of Bill is going to pass\u2014and if there is a gap of, let's say, two years before anything is implemented, and the implementation group is doing the work that you've described\u2014and we're very relieved to hear that\u2014why is this Bill being introduced now when that implementation group hasn't really come up with a strategy that could help persuade people about what implementing this Bill would look like in real life? You're asking the Welsh public to take a bit of a chance on this."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think we have, as far as possible, looked at international evidence where this legislation has been introduced. It's different for different countries, so I know it's difficult to get anything that's absolutely linked. But I don't agree that it's a bit of a chance, really. I think we are preparing very well and very carefully. As the team who have been working on this have worked through the preparation for the Bill, lots of issues have arisen as they've done that, and so you have to do that, I think, alongside the actual practical implications with the groups that are coming together, and I think the point at which we've done that is probably just about right, really."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. I hope this isn't going on to somebody else's questions, but accepting what you say, would you then be open to accepting amendments to the face of the Bill that would clarify the position for the Welsh public on certain things that may be of concern to them, which have been fed through to us? I'm not suggesting anything specific, but\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "No, no. I mean, the position is that it is a very simple, one-clause Bill. We want to keep it as simple as possible, but I'm certainly prepared to consider any issues that come up, and I think that's been the case all along. Although our preference is to keep it simple."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I understand that. It's just what's going to work as a bit of law here, isn't it? And then just finally from me, and you've made the point to a degree, that, of course, not all countries are like Wales. If we look at Ireland, and New Zealand's the one we've been looking at an awful lot, which are the most similar, their work hasn't really been in place for that long, and one of the things that, I think, you're going to need to be able persuade us of is that if the culture change to which we've already referred is going in one way anyway, and if it continues to go in that direction, that this Bill will have had a causal effect. I'm trying to establish whether the culture change is going to happen anyway, whether or not we pass this legislation."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, it does look as if a culture change is happening in any case, but the culture change will never really move, I think, as most of us want it, if there is legislation that does appear to condone the use of physical punishment, and having this reasonable punishment in law means that happens. So, I think, passing the legislation by itself will certainly not do everything\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "No. And you'll be aware that this is to go with it. I get that, but\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "You've got to have\u2014. And I think the research has all shown you've got to have an awareness campaign running along with it. That is shown. And in the other countries we've looked at, I don't think an awareness campaign was actually carried out because we are planning a really big awareness campaign because we think it's absolutely fair to the Welsh public, as you said, that they absolutely know what we're doing and everybody's aware of it. So, I think it is\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Well, can I just finish\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I know the point you're making. You're saying that this would happen in any case, maybe."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I'm suggesting it."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "But if you've got a bit of legislation there on the Bill, it will always mean that for a very minority group of parents, they will feel that they have got the right to use physical punishment against their child, and I just think it's something we should get rid of. I think it's an anachronism and it's something we should\u2014. And I think Wales has been very strong on children's rights. We've got rid of physical punishment in schools, child minders, regulated care settings. And, of course, the other point that I don't think we say enough about is that it's not just parents; it's people in loco parentis who are working in leisure centres or religious establishments or any of those unregulated settings who also have this defence. So, it's last bit in the jigsaw, really, to have it quite clear that we want to treat our children with respect and dignity and I think this will move us towards that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Well, it's the argument you've made before. I think what I was trying to get to is: how are we going to prove that this piece of legislation has worked effectively? It's about the data capture, I guess."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "What are you going to do to make sure that you acquire evidence in the future to show that this has worked, or potentially not worked? I'd be surprised if that was the case, but\u2014. Because, of course, that has an implication then on the resources for the various people you'll be asking to collect the data."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes. I think that's very important because we need to know what is the effect of the legislation we'll be bringing in. So, we will be having ongoing evaluation, we will be bringing in an independent body to evaluate. We have got ongoing monitoring and we've got ongoing monitoring surveys looking at what are the views of the public. So, yes\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "It'll be directly linked to the Bill, then, rather than that broad culture change."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "The monitoring, asking the views of the public, is generally about issues related to the Bill. The views of parents about whether this legislation\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Sorry, I don't want to labour this point."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "And awareness. How aware they are."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Basically, we need a question, 'Has this Bill stopped you smacking your child?' That's the core question. So, phrase it differently, yes?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes. Well, we are in the surveys asking how many people feel that they do smack their child, but this is any physical punishment, actually, not just smacking\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "And it's for the future, not for now."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "\u2014and how many, actually, are doing that. And it is consistently going down, as you said."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you. I don't want to take it any further."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. We're going to move on to explore some of the issues around social services now with questions from Dawn Bowden."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. Morning, Minister.\u00a0When the Association of Directors of Social Services Cymru came in,\u00a0they were saying to us that they would encourage people to report any instances, anything that they see around somebody smacking a child. That leads on to the question about whether in fact social services, then, would change their thresholds for intervention if there were more cases being referred to them. Are you fairly confident, are you certain, that that wouldn't happen, or do you think there is a danger that social services might actually say, 'Well, actually, if we're getting all these referrals, we need to think again about when and if we intervene', and the thresholds could become a bit lower?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, as you know, social services already receive and investigate reports of children being physically punished\u2014any sort of range of physical punishment\u2014and they use standard procedures to determine how to proceed, but that's done on a case-by-case basis; it's made on the individual case element. And, of course, there is a distinction between reasonable punishment and child neglect or abuse. And if this legislation is enacted, a significant proportion of the incidents of physical punishment will not require any response under the child protection procedures, and we do not expect the threshold of significant harm to change. And I know you took evidence from the ADSS, and I know Sally Jenkins gave evidence, who is one of the lead practitioners, and I understood she said: 'In terms of thresholds for children's services, we would not be anticipating a huge number of referrals to us. There may be a small number of referrals that come through. What we know from other nations is that it will peak and then settle. We recognise that's likely to happen.' So, I think\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "So, it's the threshold for intervention that's the key, really, isn't it, rather than\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes, they don't see that changing."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "So, they don't see that changing."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "No, no. And we don't see that changing."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay, that's fine. The police, when they came in to give evidence, talked about the need for the multi-agency safeguarding hubs. And what we also heard is that it's a bit inconsistent across the country. And I think you acknowledged that as well. Do you think the implementation of the Bill, and its effectiveness, is going to be dependent on us having consistently effective multi-agency safeguarding hubs right the way across the country?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "No. The effective implementation of the Bill does not depend on MASHs, as we call them for short, because bodies, social services, already work closely with the police on a day-to-day basis, really, and they have indicated their willingness to do so, and there are already well-established mechanisms in place that enable this joint working to take place. I know that the MASHs are only in certain areas, and I know that it's\u2014. I think they're probably very good to have, actually, and very good to help the work, but it's certainly not dependent on them."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay, but it would be something that you would be wanting to see developed, that eventually we would have these MASHs right across the country?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "At the moment, there are three MASHs in the south Wales police force, and one pilot MASH in the Gwent police force, but they don't operate in exactly the same way. And I know that other areas have considered having MASHs, but haven't actually brought any in. And a multi-agency strategic group, which is led by South Wales Police, has been set up, and it will consider the effectiveness of MASH arrangements in Wales, so it's very possible there will be more MASHs, but I want to reiterate that we're not dependent on MASHs in order to have the close working. But they're welcome\u2014very welcome."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Yes, because the key point from the police's point of view, I think, was that they provide a single point of contact, so it's very simple, isn't it? It's a single point of contact, and I think they were quite concerned that having that single point of contact might actually reduce the level of unnecessary police prosecutions\u2014well, the police don't prosecute, but charges and so on. So, it was just a point that they were raising."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think they are very effective and very much to be welcomed, but it's certainly not essential."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Sorry, Karen."}, {"speaker": "Karen Cornish", "content": "I was just going to say that it's probably worth saying that looking at how agencies work together will be one of the things, again, that will be looked at very carefully on the task and finish group, looking at processes and procedures. We're very alert to the fact that there are different organisations, different services, and that bringing them together, working in as consistent a way as possible, is really, really important. As the Minister has said, social services, the police and others are already committed to working together, and, actually, we just want to make sure that we develop those working practices in the best way possible, recognising that not every area will have a MASH, and reiterating, again, what the Deputy Minister has said\u2014that the effectiveness of the Bill is not predicated on a MASH in every area, but it is important that all those organisations do work together in a consistent and appropriate way."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay, that's fine. Thank you very much. The other response that we've received is from social workers. And they've talked about the fact that the social worker's workload is already very stretched, and you'll be aware of that, Minister. And I think they were getting a little bit concerned about whether a whole raft of new cases are going to land on what is an already extremely heavy workload, and how effectively they could deal with that. Would you say that those concerns, in terms of the impact of this Bill, are unfounded, or are we just saying that this is an unknown quantity at this stage, and we're going to have to wait and see?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, first of all, if I can just pay tribute to the work that social workers do."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Yes, absolutely."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Because, obviously, they\u2019re going to be essential to the successful implementation of this Bill. I was a social worker myself, so I\u2019m very happy to pay tribute to them. [Laughter.] But they do do a hard job, which isn\u2019t always recognised, I think, by the public. So, I do take this point very seriously, but, obviously, the professionals who have given evidence\u2014many of them have said they don\u2019t see there being a big rise of referrals. Jane Randall, National Independent Safeguarding Board\u2014I think she came to you\u2014said: 'there's no expectation that there's going to be a huge increase in the number of referrals\u2026I think it would be dealt with within their existing resources.' I mean, there may be an increase in reporting of incidents, initially, maybe from individuals in the community and organisations such as schools. And I think it could have an impact on the initial stages of social services activity, which I think others\u2014I think Sally Jenkins said that maybe there\u2019d be an increase, a small increase, at the beginning. But as we expect the awareness raising and the ongoing support that we\u2019ll be giving to parents\u2014we do feel that the incidents of physical punishment will be falling over time. And we don\u2019t really see that there will be an increase. But I know that social workers are stretched, and are hard-pressed\u2014and I think that was some of the evidence given to you by the British Association of Social Workers. But I think it\u2019s important to remember that they are also very strongly in support of us carrying out this legislation. But it is important to look at the realities and the practicalities. So, we\u2019re going to work very closely with social services\u2014obviously, key members of our implementation group\u2014and we will collect relevant data for a period before the actual implementation, in order to get a baseline. We want a baseline, and we are working with a small number of social services to try to get the baseline of where it is, and to see what happens when the Bill is implemented. The evidence from other countries is that they certainly have not been overwhelmed. There have been reports in New Zealand that they have not been overwhelmed, and I mentioned Ireland earlier. So, I don\u2019t think, really, we have to fear that social services would be overwhelmed, but we must be prepared, and we must get this data and monitor it closely."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Keep it monitored."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "And I guess things will level out in due course. And social services clearly having to make judgments every day\u2014they will be making those judgments quite quickly and turning them around."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "The Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, when they spoke to us, also had\u2014there was a similar kind of concern raised. They did say that they felt that they probably did have adequate resources to support the Bill. But do you think there is any danger at all that it could divert CAFCASS staff, if we have a high volume of reporting, particularly given that we\u2019ve got a 26-week limit in which to deal with those cases? Is that something that causes you any concern at this stage?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, CAFCASS are confident that they can deal with the cases that they have.\u00a0As you know, there's been a big increase in the numbers that CAFCASS is dealing with already, and they have managed to very successfully cope with the demand. So, I've got every confidence that they will be able to cope with it."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Because they were basically just saying that it's unpredictable at this stage, weren't they, so\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes. It is unpredictable. Our best views are that it will not\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Yes, because they were talking about the fact that no assessment had been made about the risk of malicious reporting. We talked about that in a number of sessions with the police and so on. So, I think their biggest concern was more about the rise in looked-after children and the impact on that in terms of their workload, and it was just a question of whether this would potentially divert any resources, I guess."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think, in terms of the malicious reporting, obviously that is something that happens a lot now and it is is likely that, perhaps\u2014. I think they felt that, in existing cases, this might be another element that should be brought in, but they seemed, in my discussions, fairly confident. I know they appeared before the committee, and they are coping very well. But, obviously, another area we are very concerned about is the rise in the number of looked-after children, and that's somewhere we want to try to do what we can to bring that down."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Just before Suzy comes in with a supplementary\u2014CAFCASS didn't come to the committee, they've submitted\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "They sent a letter\u2014that's right. Yes, sorry about that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Suzy."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Just very quickly, because I don't want to spend a lot of time on this: isn't it going to be true that any increase in workload for social services or schools or whoever is going to depend on reporting rising? Where do you see the likely rise in reporting taking place? Will it be members of the public or is it going to be professionals who feel that this is something that they can't ignore from now on?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "well, I think it would be mixed. I don't have any view or where it particularly would come from, because if there are any reports that go into agencies now about children being physically punished in any way\u2014I think they investigate those already now. But I suppose members of the public might report if they see any physical punishment going on. They would be made much more aware, we hope, by the legislation\u2014so, that may happen. But I think, in schools, if there is physical punishment reported by a child, the schools would report it in any case. But I think it's likely that there will be a small rise."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I was just curious about where you thought the main source would be\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I can't really be definitive about that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. The next questions are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "The Bill, in essence, is a simple one, of course, is it not? But what it does is\u00a0 provide a useful discussion on what good parenting is and what discipline methods are the most effective\u2014that is, discipline methods that parents can use rather than physical punishment. Do you think, therefore, that there's a need to invest much more in programmes to do with parenting and in support services for families in terms of parenting, and that as part of an early intervention strategy that's more co-ordinated and robust than what\u00a0we have at present?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, we are developing the Bill as part of a much wider package of support for children and their parents, which, of course, is already in place. This obviously includes the 'Parenting. Give it time' campaign, which aims to help parents do the best job that they can by providing positive tips on parenting and information. And we're already preparing now to update that, because, of course, that only goes up to age 7 and deals with issues about how you cope with your kids if they're difficult at meal times and if they have tantrums. It is very well used by parents. But, of course, this legislation will go up to 18 years old, and so the issues may be very different. So, we're already starting to prepare to update that 'Parenting. Give it time' campaign. And then, obviously, there's the universal services that give access to help and to promote positive parenting, delivered by local government, health, education, social services, social justice and the third sector. We will be encouraging all those agencies that provide that universal service to help support parents and to pass on this information. Then, there will be the more targeted supports, such as Flying Start and Families First, which offer help and advice. But what I've done is I've asked the officials to carry out a mapping exercise to see where the support is and where the gaps are or opportunities to do more, particularly around information and advice on positive alternatives to physical punishment, but also more widely. So, we are looking to see where the gaps are. I think parents do tend to use information and try to get help in many different ways. A very large number, actually, do use the internet. I was surprised, actually, that so many used the internet to get information. Others ask their mothers, their families, their friends, and go to agencies. It's such a wide range that we need that mapping exercise and we need to see where we need to put in more support."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "I'm pleased that you're going to conduct that exercise, because the evidence that we've received from a number of different directions is that there isn't enough investment in reality in the support services in the early years, and that there is a real need for the focus within Government go back to early intervention and to have a much more co-ordinated strategy. You've mentioned a number of agencies working on different elements, perhaps, but perhaps there's a need to bring them all together. You talk about the 'Parenting. Give it time' campaign, but I think it's an online campaign effectively, and Flying Start\u2014yes, people who attend those courses find them useful, but, of course, it's not available across Wales and it's not available to every parent. There is a scheme that is available through schools in Gwynedd\u2014perhaps you are aware of it\u2014Incredible Years, with Professor Judy Hutchings, who has been working on this for a number of years now, very successfully, where schools, parents and the children work together on parenting methods that are positive. I wonder if it's time to think about expanding that as part of an early intervention strategy across Wales. Perhaps you can't give a specific answer today, but may I ask you to take a look at that? What concerns me is that the Bill is going through but there's not enough work relating to education and having people's support for different methods, more positive methods, in my opinion, of parenting. There's a real need to move and to invest in that area and perhaps move money towards that work."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, certainly, I think that is the purpose of the mapping exercise, to see what is successful, where things need to be expanded, and that's what we're going to consider. Incredible Years\u2014I know it's very successful; I am aware of that programme. I think there are patches all over Wales of really good progress, but, certainly, I'm sure we need to give more support to parents in the early years, and I think they're only too glad to have it as well. Children are very receptive at that age and early intervention is the key to many of the issues that we have to deal with later on."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. We're going to return to some of the parenting issues later, but in the meantime we've got questions from Hefin David."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Just to take it on the next step from what Si\u00e2n Gwenllian was asking about\u2014in schools, are teachers ready for this legislation?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "On our implementation group, the education sector is represented. They've come to the first meeting of the implementation group. So, they're going to be fully involved in the preparation. Obviously, corporal punishment was banned in schools a long time ago, and I think the education sector is very supportive of this move. But in terms of the awareness for teachers to be ready for it\u2014obviously, the awareness campaign has got to be aimed at professionals in every field and certainly aimed at teachers."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, if I was a teacher in an individual school, what kind of preparation do you think I should expect?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "You know this better than me, having been more in the education field than me, but I think teachers are updated on different parts of childcare legislation now, and have in-service training days and training courses. And, certainly, perhaps this would be part of that\u2014part of the training that teachers get. This would have to be incorporated into that."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "One of the things that the National Association of Head Teachers told us was that they wouldn't want the cost of that kind of training to come from core budgets. Would you agree with that?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, I would have thought this sort of measure would be incorporated into the training they were using already, actually. I wouldn't\u00a0have seen it would need something completely separate."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, you think it should come from the core budget that they use for training?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think it could be incorporated in what they're already doing."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. And do you think that would be a significant additional cost or do you think that that would be minimal?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I would have thought it would be minimal. They already have training courses about childcare issues, and this would be something that would be absorbed into that."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "You mentioned the implementation group and the fact that educators are represented on it. Can you just be a bit clearer about how they are represented again? I'm not sure I caught that."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Do you want to, Karen, because you were at the group?"}, {"speaker": "Karen Cornish", "content": "Yes. So, education are represented on it through the Association of Directors of Education in Wales, and they have a representative on the strategic implementation group, and we are working with them to understand who else will be on the task and finish groups that we're setting up that the Minister's already talked about. And we've also had conversations with all of the trade unions. I personally went and spoke to them earlier in the year when the Bill was being introduced, received their feedback and have said that I will go back and speak with them."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. The things that are being raised so far\u2014would you say they're reflective of the concerns that the NAHT rose about, for example, funding of training? Are those kinds of issues raised? The practical implications of introducing this Bill\u2014are they raised? If not, what other issues might be raised?"}, {"speaker": "Karen Cornish", "content": "So, I think that the main concerns that you've already heard as a committee are similar concerns to those that have been raised previously. So, there's not anything in addition to the things that we have discussed, either with the trade unions or through the implementation group, or during the consultation period. And, as the Minister said, for the majority of these sort of things, teachers, education and other workforces already have procedures in place, because this comes under a safeguarding issue at one level. There are procedures and processes that are already there that they all follow. The ask will be based around those safeguarding procedures and, therefore, education and other services update their processes and procedures on a regular basis as a matter of course when any issues like this are addressed. There's a wider context here. Minister, I don't know whether you wanted to say anything about the well-being and the\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes. One of the things that I think this committee has been involved in is we want to have a whole-school approach. We want mental health and well-being to be part of the way that the whole school operates, and the culture and how schools engage with pupils and parents. And we want to create that atmosphere where there's no wrong door, where children can bring up any of the concerns that they have with any member of the school staff that they trust. And, obviously, the school staff is wider than the teachers. And so, I think the creation of that sort of atmosphere is very important in taking forward this issue."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I appreciate that. I think the Bill, though, introduces a very specific set of changes that\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "It removes the defence; that's all the Bill does."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But should a parent witness, now, smacking, then it will require a different kind of approach\u2014sorry, if a teacher were to witness smacking, it would require a different kind of approach, perhaps, to existing approaches. There shouldn't, therefore, be any surprise amongst teachers in how to deal with these things when the Bill comes in. I suppose the question I'm asking is: can we be assured that nothing you've said today in this meeting, in this committee, should be a surprise to teachers and trade unions, because that would already have been communicated through the Bill implementation group?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes, well, Karen has already said about the meetings that she's had with the unions and they are present on the implementation group, but a lot of these things happen already. They already have to make decisions about physical punishment they may be told about by children, for example\u2014probably more likely than actually witnessing anything. And they already have to make decisions on those sorts of issues, so I see this as being incorporated in with that."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. With regard to health and the communication of this to parents, we've heard about the Healthy Child Wales programme, and the fact that it has the opportunity to play a role in raising parents' awareness. Do you think that's the case?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think the Healthy Child Wales programme and the role of the health visitor is absolutely crucial, because, obviously, the health visitor is there right at the beginning. It's a universal service, and so there will be great opportunity for them to promote positive parenting in a much stronger way than they're able to do at the moment, because the fact that you have this defence does mean that the professionals aren't able to make it as clear as they want to make it that positive parenting is the way that they'd like families to go. So, I think this will be a great advantage to health visitors, and, obviously, they support it strongly, because they're trying to encourage parents not to use physical punishment now, but with their hands slightly tied behind their back, because the defence does exist."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "That's great, that's a good thing, but the concern we've got is that half the parents across Wales are not accessing the Healthy Child Wales programme, and in my community, within the Aneurin Bevan health board area, 80 per cent of parents aren't accessing the Healthy Child Wales programme. So, are there concerns that, if you rely too much on that process for communication, then parents, particularly in the early years, will be left out?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "We've got to rely on a range of ways of reaching parents, and I think that there are other times when there is a much higher ratio of children and families seen. But I think we've had that discussion with the mapping exercise that we've already mentioned, that we're going to identify where there are gaps or where we can do more, and that's where we will identify this."}, {"speaker": "Karen Cornish", "content": "I think as well that that figure relates to one contact point across the whole of the Healthy Child Wales programme, not the Healthy Child Wales programme as a whole. Maybe we could come back with some further information about the contacts, because I'm\u2014. That figure\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "The percentage relates to the contact at age three and a half, but that is exactly the kind of age when you'd expect more children to\u2014. If they were going to be smacked, it would be at that sort of age, wouldn't it, really? So, that is a concern for the committee, really, in terms of coverage."}, {"speaker": "Karen Cornish", "content": "I can appreciate that, although I would\u2014. Midwives, health visitors and others working with families would actually be giving those messages, core messages, about setting boundaries, managing behaviour, discipline, positive parenting, right from the very beginning. So, reliance on that single point of contact at that one age point is not necessarily the most appropriate, because I think there's a period from birth through to, actually, later as well, when those key health messages, those key messages around positive parenting, are and can be given. As the Minister said, we will be mapping a lot of this, but we can give you some more advice on that, if that would be helpful, about the types of messages that are given during that period of time."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Yes, I think that would be helpful. I've got some supplementaries on this, because I think the committee is concerned that at a key opportunity at age three and a half, a big chunk of families aren't having that contact that they should expect with their health visitor, really. Suzy, then Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you. It's also a time in their child's life when they're likely to be spending time not with their parents, in school or early years. And I just wanted a bit of clarification from you, Minister, on what you were saying to Hefin David about training here. I got the sense you thought this could just be slipped in as a paragraph in existing guidance, but I'm not clear about what happens to a teacher who is told by a child that they've been smacked, and they decide that they're not going to report that\u2014will they get into trouble over that? If it's part of a bigger picture that a teacher should have picked up, that's different, but, if a child tells a teacher, 'Oh, Mammy smacked me because I did such and such', is that teacher going to get into trouble if they don't report that to the police?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "If that happens now, the teacher is expected to report that now. I think they usually call in social services."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Oh, it goes to social services."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "But that clarity is needed as well."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes. That is what happens now, so would you expect a teacher to do it, yes."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. All right, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes, I'm just interested to hear a bit more about the mapping exercise that you've referred to, which I think is really important, but it is going to show up a lot of gaps geographically, but also in service provision for different groups of families. It's all very well doing a mapping exercise, but what is the purpose of that, and how are you going to ensure that those gaps don't exist in future? Maybe we could have a note about what the timetable is for this exercise, and more in-depth understanding perhaps about what your intentions are, and how you intend to take it forward once you've done the mapping exercise."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes. We absolutely acknowledge that there is a lot more work to be done, and we know that we have to work hard at this to reach every family. Obviously, the information that we've had about the Healthy Child Wales, the health boards will be monitoring that information and will be\u2014. I think they're going to establish a project board to consider the themes that are coming out from the Healthy Child Wales, and so that will be certainly addressed there. And we will absolutely acknowledge that we expect that there will be work to be done."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And there will be investment needed, obviously, to fill in those gaps, which means a significant shift in the way Government now looks at its budget, and a shift towards that early prevention."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think we all agree that early prevention is the key for happy, healthy children, and so we'll certainly consider everything that arises."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on the police and the Crown Prosecution Service from Suzy."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. You've said repeatedly that the intention of this Bill isn't to criminalise parents, and I believe that that's not your intention. So, what I'm interested in hearing about is how you\u2014or the work that you've done to satisfy yourself that the huge majority of parents that are going to be caught up in the change of this Act won't result in parents getting anywhere near the CPS, for example. Obviously, there are going to be occasions where there are recidivists who keep smacking despite perhaps earlier warnings, or families get identified as doing something far more serious with their children than this, and I'm not talking about those\u2014I'm talking about the people who are currently protected, if I can put it like that. I'm very interested in hearing what you've got to say about out-of-court disposals and pre being charged activity. I wonder if you can tell us a little bit about the assessment and work that you've done in that area."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Right. Well, there are a number of out-of-court disposals that the police can use, because the police want to respond in a positive and proportionate way. The use of out-of-court disposals is actually a non-devolved responsibility, but we'll be working\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "That's what I wanted to ask you about."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes, they are non-devolved, but we will be working with the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice, the CPS, the police and the police and crime commissioners to consider suitable interventions. And one of the main areas of focus of the National Police Chiefs' Council's national strategy\u00a0is to reduce the current six disposal options to just two. And that's going to be conditional caution and community resolution, and the four Welsh police forces are going to be moving towards this two-tier approach, which they believe will make for greater consistency. So, what we're doing is we are exploring, with the police liaison unit, how we can develop a suitable diversion scheme, with a focus on advice and support on positive alternatives to physical punishment, and how we can tie that into the wider activity. And, obviously, it all depends on the individual circumstances of the case, because the other thing we're going to look at is the individual. But it's possible then we could get a diversion scheme provided through a community resolution order; it could be potentially be given instead of a caution. And so that would be\u2014you know, parents could be referred to a scheme. So, that's what we're discussing with the police liaison unit at the moment."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you for confirming that, but even that is quite far down the process from the day that a smack is reported, and, as you know, particularly as soon as the police get involved, and even social services, if a record is made of even a complaint\u2014even if that complaint goes no further, even if you don't get anywhere near an arrest, shall we say, that is logged in certain parts of the system and will need to be revealed in certain circumstances. I'm thinking of the enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service check in particular, but there are other instances as well. Have you done any impact assessment on that, because that is a\u2014we're talking about a situation where there's a massive impact, potentially, on an adult, when there have been no grounds at all to worry that a child's rights have been infringed, for example? It will happen in malicious reporting, but it could happen in reporting where an apparent battery has taken place, but it turns out to have been something completely different\u2014you know, pushing a child's hand away, that sort of thing. The police are not going to want to take that any further at all, but it's on their records. How are you going to protect parents in those circumstances, within our legislative competence?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, the issue of non-conviction data obviously doesn't just apply to this Bill we're bringing in; it applies to everything. So, it's something that you can look at in a general sense\u2014that the police can visit and there's no further action, but that could be for anything\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "But this is very sensitive, this area."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "\u2014and it's still logged. But, obviously, this does have an issue in terms of, particularly, the DBS checks and if you needed an enhanced certificate, if you wanted to be a teacher, a childcare worker, or those sorts of occupations. But, when disclosing information held locally, the police follow the quality assurance framework, and information must pass certain tests, which are related to considerations of relevance, substantiality and proportionality, and considerations of the safety aspects as well of disclosing information. And the police must record their thought process, their rationale, explaining how and why they reached all of their conclusions and their decisions. And this information is then assessed by the chief officer to determine whether it's reasonable to believe that it's relevant, and whether, in their opinion, it ought to be disclosed. Information should only be disclosed if it meets both of those requirements. So\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Is that in all jobs, though, because my understanding is that there are certain professions where that exemption doesn\u2019t apply, and they\u2019re likely to be the ones that are really relevant to the removal of the defence? So, I\u2019m not talking about, I don't know, people who might work as volunteers; I\u2019m literally talking about teachers and doctors, maybe dentists."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, we have done some work on this, haven\u2019t we? Do you want to say about that, Karen?"}, {"speaker": "Karen Cornish", "content": "Yes. So, it does apply across all professions, and we have been in discussion with the DBS about when and how and why information would be released, and also how often. And our understanding at this moment in time is that this type of information is released only in a very, very small number of cases. I think we\u2019re talking less than 1 per cent of cases\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "One per cent of what figure though?"}, {"speaker": "Karen Cornish", "content": "\u2014in the last year. It\u2019s about 1 per cent of 2,500, something like that. I haven\u2019t got the exact figures with me."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, but it helps us to understand the general amount\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Karen Cornish", "content": "So, it\u2019s about two, three, four cases in a year where this type of information is disclosed. It\u2019s information that, obviously, we have got, but I think it\u2019s really important to understand that this is a really rigorous process that the police and the DBS have in place. They consider everything in the round before they would even consider actually releasing any information that's non-conviction information in relation to employment."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "But this is a new consideration for them. They haven't tested their ability to get their judgment right on this one yet. Are you concerned that, in order to be on the safe side, if I can put it like that, there's an increased likelihood of disclosure\u2014which actually might disappear over time, because there's an opportunity to exercise judgment more frequently and get the balance right?"}, {"speaker": "Karen Cornish", "content": "I think they do have to consider non-conviction information now and some of that non-conviction information may be in relation to physical punishment of a child. I think you've received evidence from the police saying that there are 18,000 or so incidents in one police force area alone, where information is potentially on their records, and yet we understand that a very, very small proportion of non-conviction information is released to an employer during a recruitment process. So, our expectation, based on that information, would be that it would remain at a very low level."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. And just to finish off on this one: we don't have legislative competence in this particular area, so we are relying on goodwill and the conversations that you have, which I'm sure are very productive. What will happen if we start getting instances where perhaps that judgment hasn't been exercised correctly? There's nothing, as a Government, you can do to challenge that particularly."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I can only emphasise the very close working relationships we've got and I think will continue to build as we introduce this legislation. We've got it all set up and it's been very productive so far."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, I appreciate that. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you, Suzy. Just before we move on, could I ask, then\u2014? Maybe the committee would be grateful for a note providing an update on the latest work that the Government has done on out-of-court disposals, including estimated costs. We'd also appreciate a note on the Welsh Government's discussions with the DBS and the figures that Karen just referred to, if that's okay, please. Thank you. The next questions are from Hefin on resources."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "When you first appeared before the committee at the beginning of Stage 1, I wasn't hugely reassured by the evidence you gave on the resource implications of the Bill. It seems to be relying, to a great extent, on the limited number of reporting of cases that's likely to happen, as we've seen in the evidence we've received.\u00a0That's largely been recognised by the stakeholders who've given evidence, but isn't there still the potential for a degree of unknown costs to come into this, and what planning have you done for those unknown costs\u2014those unforeseen costs\u2014that might occur?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I feel that\u2014. You're right that there always could be unknown costs, but we are doing our very best to prepare to cover all eventualities that we can anticipate. For example, I've committed to fund the high-intensity awareness-raising campaign, and committed to carry out a mapping exercise to establish whether there are any gaps in the parenting support. We know that evidence from other countries does show that, if we bring in this legislation and raise awareness, it does change people's attitudes, so there may, in the long term, be a saving if we do that. But we are committed to working with organisations to put in place arrangements so that we're able to collect the data so that we know what the impact is. But I just have to repeat that all our evidence, looking at other countries, is that there isn't a huge increase in the workload."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "No. I think you can make the argument for precedent elsewhere, but you can also say that every country has a different culture and approach to how it raises children, and therefore there'll be a number of differences as well. The explanatory memorandum raises some specific cases. It talks about unknown costs in relation to social services as a result of a potential increasing referrals; family courts and CAFCASS Cymru as a result of a potential increase in allegations, which we talked about; the CPS and a higher volume of requests for charging advice from the police; and the review of training and guidance offered by organisations involved in the safeguarding of children. All those things we've talked around, but what would be reassuring for the committee is, perhaps, if you could give us a broad figure, which the Government would say, 'We'll need to set this number aside in order to be prepared for the implementation of this Bill.' Would you be willing to present that at some point during the passage of the Bill?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think we have to rely on what the people who run those organisations are telling us. Certainly, the CPS say that they can cope. CAFCASS\u00a0say that they can cope. And it is very difficult to anticipate what impact there would be on social services. The people who are managing social services say they don't anticipate a big impact. I think the other important thing to recognise is that this area of work is already dealt with by all these people. So, the CPS is already involved in changing its guidance all the time, so it's not going to be much of an impact for them to actually have to do that over this issue. Social services are already dealing with calls and referrals about the physical punishment of children already, including reasonable punishment. And so it's not a new category of work. I accept that we're working in a situation where there's a general pressure on public services, but I think this area that we're legislating on here is part of what everybody's doing already. And so I don't see it as such a big thing in terms of impact."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "That's a perfectly reasonable answer, but then what about providing a ballpark figure for a kind unforeseen fund that you might set aside?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I don't think it's possible to do that. We have to measure it as we go along. We've got to get the data. The data will show\u2014. We've got to have baseline data to begin with, and that's what's so difficult to get, because we can't get that from other countries. Only New Zealand recorded any incidents before they actually brought in the legislation, and they did that for three months beforehand. That's why we've been looking at New Zealand a lot of the time, just to make predictions. But we've got to rely on the data. One of these sub-groups is looking at data, so that sub-group should be very productive, I think. And then we will be actually able to see what happens. But I don't think we can respond to that."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay, that's fine. And the last question, with regard to resourcing, just to understand the process of how this ties into the wider budgeting\u2014did you and your officials sit down with the Finance Minister and the First Minister's officials to discuss the costing of this? I imagine so. What was the nature of that kind of discussion?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Some of the costings are decided. For example, the advertising, the awareness-raising campaign\u2014that's \u00a32.2 million over six years. So the decision has been made about that. I don't know if there were further discussions right at the beginning of this process."}, {"speaker": "Karen Cornish", "content": "There have been discussions. The discussions tend to be positive. We can't really say any more beyond that at this moment in time."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. And who were the discussions with?"}, {"speaker": "Karen Cornish", "content": "There has been an in-the-round discussion before the Bill was introduced, at which the First Minister and the finance Minister and others were present."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. And I imagine it's gone to Cabinet for discussion."}, {"speaker": "Karen Cornish", "content": "The consultation and then the Bill going forward has been discussed by Cabinet, and gone through Cabinet processes, as you would expect."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, are we able to say that the Government as a whole is satisfied that there isn't going to be a huge impact on resource as a result of the introduction of this Bill?"}, {"speaker": "Karen Cornish", "content": "I think what you can say is that the Government are satisfied that they are supportive of the Bill and have put the Bill forward. I think you can say that."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. Did you want to come in?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Yes. Are you satisfied that that amount of money\u2014\u00a32.5 million over five years [correction: \u00a32.2 million over six years]\u2014is going to be enough? From memory, with the organ donation Bill, the amount was something in the region of around \u00a37 million that was set aside, I think. Or maybe I'm misremembering that, but\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Karen Cornish", "content": "I think it was about \u00a34 million\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "\u00a34 million\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Karen Cornish", "content": "Something like that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "So, there's a disparity, then. That was a few years ago. You've got to reach a lot of people, haven't you, with this, including some pretty hard-to-reach groups as well. Are you confident that amount of money is going to be enough?"}, {"speaker": "Karen Cornish", "content": "We are as confident as we can be at this moment in time. We are obviously going to be working with focus groups and others to look at what sorts of messaging there will need to be. But in terms of the initial stages of the awareness campaign, we are, as I say, as confident as we can be, based on what we know."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Hefin, on human rights."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I just wanted to ask a very specific question on human rights, because, you know, when it comes to appeals, there are a variety of articles under the European Convention on Human Rights that might be used with regard to a challenge to the law as enacted. So, I'll ask you the question very directly. For the purpose of the record, can you outline to us the assessment you've made in preparation for this Bill in relation to the balancing of relevant articles of the European Convention on Human Rights, including but not limited to article 8 on the respect for private life; article 9, freedom of conscience and religion; article 3, the right to protection from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment; and article 14, protection from discrimination?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Thank you very much. We have given a great deal of thought, as you can imagine, to the human rights considerations as set out in our impact assessments, and it's ultimately a question how we find a balance between the rights of children as well as parents, who both enjoy rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. So, article 3 is the prohibition of torture: 'No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.' In ensuring that children are protected from physical punishment in the same way as adults, the Bill is following that requirement of article 3, and the positive obligations on states to protect individuals from ill treatment or punishment that is contrary to article 3. And then, in terms of article 8, right to respect for private and family life, 'Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.' Some of those who are opposed to the prohibition of physical punishment have cited article 8, private and family life, and also cited article 9, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as potentially protecting the right for parents to decide how best to punish their children, including the use of physical punishment. That is used as an argument by those who are opposed to stopping physical punishment. But these rights are not absolute, and action can therefore be taken that interferes with them, provided the interference is justified. It's the Government's view that the Bill's provisions are necessary in order to protect the rights and freedom of children. We are looking here from the point of view of children. The Bill's provisions are regarded as proportionate measures, and given the fundamental importance of protecting children from inhumane or degrading punishment or other ill treatment, we do consider that we have balanced the rights in a proportionate way. And then, article 10, freedom of expression, and article 14, prohibition of discrimination\u2014these rights are not absolute and action can be taken, therefore, that interferes with them, providing the interference is justified. We don't think it's clear that article 10 and 14 rights are being interfered with, but even if they are, we consider we can justify the interference in order to protect the rights and freedoms of children. I don't know, Emma, whether you wanted to add anything to any of that."}, {"speaker": "Emma Gammon", "content": "Only that we set out\u2014. I think it's the equality impact assessment that sets out the positive and negative impacts of the proposal and the balancing of the rights enjoyed by both parents and children."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. There are some questions from Vikki on awareness raising. Can I ask for concise questions please?"}, {"speaker": "Vikki Howells AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. So, last week, the Welsh Government published its baseline survey of public attitudes to physical punishment of children, and that showed us that 58 per cent of the public already thought the law did not allow parents to smack their children. You could look at this two ways. You could think glass half full, which suggests that we don't have many people to try and convince of that. But on the flipside of that, would you suggest, perhaps, that that data shows there is a challenge faced by the Welsh Government to make sure the public understand the proposed legislation, given that more than half of the population, according to those statistics, have a complete misunderstanding of the current law?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Certainly, I think that finding is reflected in people I speak to who do think that the law does not allow parents to hit their children. I mean, I'm personally very reassured that 58 per cent of the public think the law doesn't allow that to happen because I think, well, they're not hitting their children, so we're over 50 per cent of where we want to get. So, I think that is a good thing, but it does highlight the fact that the legislation, as it is, is confused. I think it makes a very good case for saying that we do need to simplify this legislation. We need much greater clarity in the law for professionals who are working and trying to help parents, and for parents themselves. So, I think that this is a case for saying that it's very important that we carry out this legislation to make it all much clearer. But I am pleased that 58 per cent of the public think the law has already changed."}, {"speaker": "Vikki Howells AM", "content": "One of the most consistent messages that this committee has heard is that the proposed law won't work unless there's a significant campaign to raise awareness with members of the public. We know that Sweden went to considerable lengths to publicise the change in the law there, and I can remember attending a cross-party group, chaired by yourself, Deputy Minister, where we heard evidence from Ireland to the same effect, as well\u2014the necessity of the public awareness campaign. You already said that a duty on the face of the Bill to raise awareness is not necessary, but then, in your answer to Suzy Davies, you said you would consider putting some things on the face of the Bill. So, can you explain to us your key arguments surrounding this issue?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I absolutely agree that it's essential that we do have a big awareness campaign, because all the research we've had shows, in fact, that if you don't have the awareness campaign, the legislation won't be as effective. So, we need a joint effort; I'm totally committed to doing that. I've said it publicly here, and I'm saying it again. I don't think it's absolutely necessary to have it on the face of the Bill, but as I said to Suzy, I'm prepared to consider anything the committee is bringing forward because I'm very keen for this Bill to progress through this process and to learn from it. So, I'm saying that I'm prepared to consider it."}, {"speaker": "Vikki Howells AM", "content": "Thank you, that's very useful. And finally, New Zealand is an oft-cited example, mentioned in the explanatory memorandum as well. So, we know New Zealand prohibited physical punishment in 2007, but yet in a non-binding referendum two years later, 87.5 per cent of voters voted 'no' in response to the question, 'Should a smack, as part of good parental correction, be a criminal offence in New Zealand?' On what basis, then, are you confident that this sort of polarisation won't happen in Wales, especially considering the current political climate there is out there?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, what we trying to do is we're trying to take this forward in as consensual a way as we possibly can. We're very keen that we listen to the views of everybody. All those people who don't agree with us, who are a minority, it seems, we want to hear what they've got to say, taking very seriously all the points that are raised here by the committee. I haven't seen any sign of any polarisation in any way that I would be concerned about, because, certainly, the people who do oppose the Bill, I've met with them, I know they've given evidence to your committee and the views of parents have been taken into account. We completely accept that we want to listen to the views of people who don't agree. I hope that they then, if the Bill does become law, will then accept and respect the democratic process.

That's where the support does lie. And it's older people who are much less likely to support the legislation, and I think it's all linked to what many of us were used to, what happened in our childhoods, when it was accepted and it was part of the time that this was what you did. But we have moved on now and we're in a different era. So, I think many older people, because they smacked their children or were smacked themselves, have felt a degree of resistance, perhaps, to the Bill. But as I say, I think times have changed. We want to respect children's rights and what happened in the past is in the past now, and we want to have a new era for respecting children's human rights and dignity. And I think I'll go back to what I said: I don't see that children's rights to dignity is going to happen if a big person is able to hit a small person."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Just to clarify, Janet's referring to the committee's consultation and the percentage of responses that we've had."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes, we had a specific section, but because time is moving quite fast, perhaps you could give us a note in response. Some witnesses saw a risk that the Bill could have a disproportionate impact on specific groups\u2014women, because they are the main carers, minority ethnic groups and very young children. So, if it would be possible for us to receive a note as to whether you agree that this will have a disproportionate impact upon them, and if so, what would be the mitigating measures you would take. But, specifically, we have heard from several witnesses and the equality impact assessment of the Bill does acknowledge that a low income is a risk factor in the use of physical punishment and that this could have a negative impact specifically on this group of parents. Now, we know that Flying Start is available to try to mitigate that to some degree, but of course not all low-income families live within a Flying Start area, so what mitigating work will you be undertaking in that regard?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes.

In addition, children need to be part of the discussion in terms of children having a discussion around this point, which would affect them.

Increased austerity was a part of this. In addition, an increased awareness of adverse childhood experiences and the emphasis of the impact on children of domestic abuse also affected this.

We've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies and Jack Sargeant and I'm very pleased to welcome Jayne Bryant back, who is substituting for Jack today. Are there any declarations of interest from Members, please? No. Okay, thank you. Item 2, then, this morning, is our sixth scrutiny session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. I'm very pleased to welcome our witnesses this morning: Sally Jenkins, who is chair of All Wales Heads of Children\u2019s Services and is here representing the Association of Directors of Social Services; Alastair Birch, who is senior system leader for equalities and safeguarding at Pembrokeshire County Council, who is here representing the Association of Directors of Education Wales; and Councillor Huw David, who is the Welsh Local Government Association spokesperson for health and social care and leader of Bridgend County Borough Council. So, thank you all for attending this morning. We're very pleased to have you here. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so, if you're happy, we'll go straight into questions and I'll start just by asking about your general support for the Bill, which is outlined in the evidence. Can you just explain why you think the current law is ineffective or unclear?"}, {"speaker": "Alastair Birch", "content": "Bore da\u2014bore da, bawb. So, I'm Alastair Birch. The statement, really, from ADEW is that the rights of the child should be educated and achieved, really, under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The current legislation has been criticised, obviously, by the UN concerning the defence of reasonable punishment still being within our current legislation. So, we will always\u2014ADEW will always\u2014advocate that the rights of the child be upheld, so that is really the fundamental aspect in terms of the statement from ADEW, and the position of ADEW is that the rights of the child are fundamental in this process. And there are certain articles\u2014. I know that the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011 made sure that article 3 and article 4, article 12 and article 37 were a focus in terms of making sure that the best interests of the child were put first, that children expressing their views and opinions was a priority. And we know, for safeguarding purposes, that the express opinions of the child and the voice of the child are a fundamental aspect of any safe environment, whether it be a school or college. So, that is\u2014the position is really following that legal position under the Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Nothing to add at this stage, no?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "I'll just add, on behalf of ADSS and on behalf of children's services and social services more widely, for us, this is not a change in our position, this is not new; this is a position that we, on behalf of the leaders of social services across Wales, have taken over many years, going back 20, 25 years. I think what we would say is that we really welcome this Bill and we welcome the proposed change for the clarity it would bring\u2014the clarity that it would bring for children, for parents and for professionals. I think what we would recognise is that this is a very little-used piece of legislation, so it's rare, it's not as if this is something that is going to cast great change across the scene for children and families in Wales, but what it will do is represent a change in the reality of how we care and nurture our children. I would echo absolutely what Alastair has said in terms of the rights of the child, but equally, in terms of all of our policies in Wales in terms of promoting well-being for children, this has to be key. So, for us, this is about a natural progression of change in how we care for our children in Wales. For children's services at the very sharp end of this world, for us, it brings a true clarity. This continues with an ambiguity in how we treat our children and how we care for our children, and the shift for us brings that very much needed clarity."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. The committee has already heard different views about whether there's clear evidence that physical punishment is harmful to children. What evidence does the work of social services provide about whether physical punishment is actually harmful?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "Obviously, what you'll all be aware of is that, as part of the consultation for this Bill, the Public Policy Institute did a further piece of research to look at the impact of physical punishment on children. A number of things that we know\u2014we know from across the world that the evidence is that introducing legislation or changing legislation in this way improves children's positions within their families. What we know is that children themselves, as Alastair has already referred to, really find physical punishment demeaning and harmful, and for children it is an emotionally damaging experience. Now, there may be disagreement about that, there will be different views on that, but that's the voice of the child in this debate. The voice of the child is very clear that physical punishment is for them harmful. I think what we would also say is that, in the world that we work in, it's part of a continuum, and, whilst this is an element of how children are cared for, what we see is a continuum where an acceptance of how we treat children in a particular way perpetuates throughout our work. By changing this, it helps that shift to that absolute recognition that our children must be cared for in a way that is physically safe in all dimensions for them."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We've had evidence from the equal protection network that the reasonable punishment defence undermines child protection and fails to protect children because it permits an arbitrary level of violence, which invades children's physical integrity, making it a potential pathway to more serious physical or sexual abuse, and you did refer to that just now. Is there anything you want to add on that?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "I would echo that. I think there is something in this that is about our culture, about how we see our children. It is about how we see our smallest and most vulnerable people, and if it is acceptable it opens the door to those other, more extreme versions of violence, which then complicates the issue for us. This is about clarity, and, whilst there is an argument that this is a small episode for a child, it's not a small episode for a child, it is a major episode for a child, and I think absolutely, as you said, the potential for it then to lead on, and over gradation and time to increase the risk for children, is clearly there."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. The final question from me: your written evidence emphasises the need for greater clarity around the definition of what constitutes corporal punishment, but that contrasts with what we've been told by the children's commissioner and the equal protection network, who've emphasised the importance of simplicity in the Bill. How do you respond to that view, and is what you're calling for essential to be on the face of the Bill?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "It's not essential for it to be on the face of the Bill. What we would like to see is discussion within the implementation phase for that nuancing. Absolutely agree in terms of simplicity\u2014I think that is really important\u2014and I've already mentioned clarity. What we don't want to do is further confuse the position. We know that the legislation in different countries has done that, and there are ways that you can do it, but what we would welcome is an opportunity during the implementation phase for discussion."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "And, as a principle, obviously we would welcome full involvement, and we know there's the commitment from Welsh Government to full involvement in the implementation, because, as with every piece of legislation, implementation is the most important part, and we would want to ensure there is that commitment to a major awareness-raising campaign, and there is that from Welsh Government, because we need to take families, carers and parents with us on this. Also we need to ensure that there is that support available to parents and carers that do sometimes struggle with parenting, and that needs to be a universal offer across Wales. If we're to progress with this, that has to be an option that is offered to every parent in Wales."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "Local authorities have already been very heavily involved in terms of looking at this Bill and exploring what the issues are and the discussions and looking at what the implications from a local authority perspective will be, as Huw describes, both in terms of the awareness raising, early support and intervention and prevention services for families against the backdrop of the current issues that we have in local government, but also awareness raising\u2014because absolutely it is key that families come with us on this journey. This is not an imposition. This is embracing a culture and a value system for our children."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. I've got some questions now from Dawn Bowden on the implementation of the Bill."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. So, you've pre-empted me, Huw."}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "Right. Sorry. I've got good eyesight; I can't see\u2014. [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "You've already said, obviously, that you're looking towards working with Welsh Government in terms of its implementation. What's been your role so far in terms of the implementation of the Bill\u2014local authorities generally, now? Have you had a role? Has Welsh Government been involving you in discussions around the introduction of the Bill so far?"}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "Yes. So, obviously we were consulted\u2014a key consultee\u2014but also our officials have worked very closely with Welsh Government officials to make sure this is implemented successfully, if it is progressed."}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "Our involvement with this, from a social services perspective, goes back over two years, directly in working towards this point, never mind the history in terms of work towards this area. But, very directly in relation to this Bill, we were first involved at least two years ago, to recollect, and that was in a series of workshops with other agencies, for example Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service Cymru and the police, and looking in real depth at what the implications would be for us as agencies to look at what the likely trajectory would be in terms of our pathways for referral into our services and what that might mean for us. And then particularly, for example, with CAFCASS Cymru in relation to private law, what the fallout might be, and then what, if anything\u2014and that's the discussion that we need to have\u2014that could mean for children's services in particular, given the pressures that we're already under. So, we've been in constant, I suppose, involvement in terms of the Bill already, as part of the consultation, in terms of the focus groups and in terms of direct work with Welsh Government officials to take this forward. And we are absolutely committed to continuing with that work."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. You touched there on the pressures that you're already under, which we fully appreciate, but you also mentioned in answers to Lynne Neagle earlier on that you welcomed the Bill in terms of its clarity. So, are you confident that the Bill can be implemented without any major impact on your capacity to deal with it?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "We've done\u2014. A number of local authorities\u2014my own included, Newport City Council, has done some work to look at what the likely impact would be and then actually to look at what some of that costing would need to be. Further work is needed on that area, and that needs to be carried out during the implementation phase. I think what we've done is we've looked internationally at what the impact has been elsewhere when similar legislation has been introduced to try and gauge, but that's difficult to do in terms of comparable nations and size and also different systems. And obviously our approach in terms of children and pedagogy is very different from some of the nations that have already done this. I wouldn't like to say one way or the other, because I think, in terms of that culture shift, it could be a double impact on us in terms of increased referrals because of increased awareness, but it could also be, I suppose, as Huw alludes to, that, if we're looking at ensuring greater awareness of preventative services and support services for parents, actually people coming to the fore and asking us for those services as well. So, at this stage, I think what we would want to say is that we continue to be fully involved in the implementation phase, to look at what the cost implications for that could be, and not just for the local authorities but also the police, CAFCASS Cymru, for third sector organisations involved in preventative services. I don't think any of that should undermine the position in terms of children and their rights within our society. So, a difficult answer, in the sense that\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "No, I understand. What you're saying is that this is a piece of legislation that, in your view, is a good piece of legislation. It's setting out to, hopefully, achieve what the purpose of it is and you will deliver what you need to. Can I ask you whether, then, you've also given thought to the impact on\u2014we've talked about social services, but the impact on other services, like housing, education and so on? You're obviously coming at it from slightly different angles in other sections."}, {"speaker": "Alastair Birch", "content": "We are part of the universal service for children, and we very much work in co-operation with the WLGA and our social care colleagues, and we've been part of that consultation. In terms of education, the main changes, or adaptations, would be around training and awareness. And, in terms of the Bill, there needs to be the clarity\u2014ambiguity would be bad\u2014in terms of making sure that safeguarding leads within all schools have the right training and support. So, really, that's the key element there, and then obviously the preventative services for the parents that schools can signpost, and sometimes possibly even host, in terms of being community schools. These positive parenting approaches that\u2014. I have colleagues who have worked in that area for many years and see the benefits in how those positive parenting approaches make a difference to families."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "So, from your point of view, it's awareness raising, is it?"}, {"speaker": "Alastair Birch", "content": "It's awareness raising; it's making sure that professionals are fully briefed on necessary changes, that there's very little ambiguity, that we are aware that\u2014. We still have that duty to report whenever there is any safeguarding concern. That'll still be part of the all-Wales child protection procedures.\u00a0That won't change, and that duty is always going to be there for all our professionals. But that awareness raising and training will be the key, and then, obviously, working in co-operation with our colleagues."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay, I understand that. Have you been given an indication of how long you've got between Royal Assent and implementation, and whether you've thought through any of the key milestones that need to be implemented?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "There's a group proposed that would be a strategic leadership group in the steering group that we're part of, which is now laying out what would happen after Royal Assent if that is given. So, we will work towards that."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. My final question, Chair, is about some of the responses we've had to this committee that say that the state should not get involved in family life\u2014I'm sure you've heard those views\u2014unless it's in the most serious circumstances. To what extent do you think that this Bill undermines the existing local authority responsibilities, or don't you?"}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "The state's paramount role is to protect children from harm. That is our legal responsibility, it's our moral responsibility, and we will discharge that. And there is obviously a view\u2014it's a view that is enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child\u2014that physical punishment, physical harm to a child is harm to a child, and we should be preventing that and act to prevent that. That would be the position of the Welsh Local Government Association, and we also respect the mandate that Members of the National Assembly for Wales have too. And we believe that children can be raised by parents without recourse to physical punishment, effectively, and we'd support parents in that. We do not believe that in the 50 nations across the world where such legislation exists that the state is interfering in family life unnecessarily. We believe this action reflects a cultural change, a sea change that's taken place in Wales over the last 30 to 40 years, where the vast majority of parents now say that they do not use it themselves, they do not support it, and we believe this is actually a reflection of what has happened in Welsh society. We support Assembly Members in the view that the natural progression of that is that children's rights are protected across Wales."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "So, I've got largely positive feedback from you in terms of the Bill and its intentions, and so on. Do you foresee any unintended consequences for this Bill?"}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "If we implement it carefully, if we implement it with the right resources, then I hope not. I think not. But as with every piece of legislation, it is about the implementation, it is about the cultural change as well, and that's why I cannot overstress the importance of making sure that resources are made available, because our social services departments\u2014children's social services in particular\u2014are overstretched. They are at breaking point\u2014make no bones about it\u2014and they are dealing with children who are facing serious harm and neglect. We are having record numbers of contacts from police, from teachers, from doctors and, of course, from children themselves who are experiencing that harm and neglect. And obviously, we want to focus our energy and our attention on those children. Equally, though, we don't want to lose sight of those families and children that are experiencing significant problems, but who we want to support through our early intervention and prevention programmes, and that is why it is important that there is investment in those programmes, so that children do not end up in that terrible position where we have to, for their safety, take them from their birth families to protect them. And the reality is, in Wales, that we are doing that to more children than we've done for a long time, and the numbers are growing across Wales. And that is only because of the most appalling neglect and abuse, because there is no way that any judge would permit us to act to make a child safe if it was not for that fact, and the facts are there. So, I don't want that focus to be lost, but, of course, we welcome and understand the need to progress this piece of legislation."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "That rise that you talk about here, is that due to more interventions, greater awareness, more incidents? I'm trying to link this to the Bill in terms of whether the Bill is actually going to give you more work to do in those areas."}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "On the reasons for the rise in the numbers of looked-after children in Wales, which are higher than those in England, and also the numbers of contacts that we have across the local authorities, the work of the care crisis review, which was completed last year; the work of Isabelle Trowler, who's the chief social worker in England; countless research and reports that have taken place in the last 18 months; and currently the public law working group, under the auspices of the president of the family court, would all indicate that it's multifactorial. So, what you have is a range of reasons that have led to the increasing numbers of children becoming looked after across England and Wales. What you can't do is identify a single reason. There have been headlines that have said, 'Is it increased austerity?' That is clearly a part of this. Is it in Wales an increased awareness of adverse childhood experiences and the emphasis of the impact on children of, for example, domestic abuse? Is it because of our understanding of what happens to children in those households? All of that research would say it's all of those things. And then, when you also add in changes in our practice with our colleagues in the judiciary, changes in our police service, but also changes in our preventative services, you've got that whole range of elements. And there is going on across the local authorities and Welsh Government a huge amount of work to try to address and understand that, and then to ameliorate that. Children who need to be in care for safety need to be in care, but what we have to do is get to a point where fewer children come into care and we're able to protect them, firstly, and secondly where those children who are in care are cared for in a way that delivers the best possible outcomes for them. So, there is no simple answer unfortunately. I think, in terms of this Bill and unintended consequences, I agree absolutely with everything that Huw has said. My job is around children at that far end, but what this Bill does is it brings clarity. It brings a clarity even for those children at that very far end. It takes away even that point of discussion that this could possibly be okay, and I think that's important to hang on to."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. Sorry."}, {"speaker": "Alastair Birch", "content": "One unintended consequences is that I think that there will be an increased focus on the UNCRC. And, in terms of children having a discussion around this point, children need to be part of that discussion. It's something that affects them. And a key aspect of education is the voice of the child. It has become significantly\u2014. It's changed completely in the last 10 years, and it is\u00a0one of the key things in terms of us driving improvements."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Would that be something that you would be looking to do in schools?"}, {"speaker": "Alastair Birch", "content": "Anything that improves the voice of the child in any educational context is good and it's very powerful for the children. And it improves their educational experiences, encouraging the opportunities for them to discuss the issues, the adverse childhood experiences that they encounter, which are significant, and it's our educational professionals that are facing this day-in, day-out. They've become a very highly trained workforce, they're ACE aware, they're trauma aware, and anything that focuses, even increases, their professionalism and understanding around a particular point, and also\u2014. So it's a positive unintended consequence, shall we say, that it could reinvigorate some of the voice of the child discussion within various contexts."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "We've got some specific questions now on implementation for social services, from Janet Finch-Saunders."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. If this Bill becomes law, would you encourage members of the public to contact social services departments if they do see a child being smacked?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "We already encourage members of the public to contact social services or the police, depending on the circumstances. Interestingly, I'm picking\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "What, if a child is being smacked now?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "Yes. If a child is being smacked now, we would ask that people contact. We have a duty to report, as professionals. But if you were walking out, and you saw something happening to a child, in the same way as if you saw something to an adult."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Right."}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "So, I think that the challenge is about\u2014we've all probably, sadly, witnessed incidents in the doctor's reception, or in a supermarket, and we've failed to do something about it. And I think we then walk away and feel pretty guilty about that, realistically, when you see something happening to a child in a particular circumstance. I think we can't ignore the fact that a child is being assaulted in those circumstances."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. A campaign opposing this Bill, Be Reasonable Wales, have said that 'If the law is changed, the consequences for parents will be considerable.' It also says, 'Anyone accused or convicted of assaulting a child\u2014under the new definition\u2014' so, I suppose you could argue, a minor tap\u2014 'will be subject to long-term social services involvement in their family and social stigma.' To what extent is this accurate, and, also, will thresholds for social services intervention change if the Bill is enacted?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "There are a number of parts to that. Firstly, in terms of long-term social services intervention in a family's life, I think, for people to be fully aware of the very few numbers of families where we have long-term intervention currently, even where there is what would be perceived as very significant abuse. What we do is we go in for short periods in families' lives, to support them to work with their strengths, to work with them and their family members. It's not about us going into families, whatever some of the public perception may be. Our aim is to get in and get out. So, in terms of long-term intervention, what we want is for families to find their own solutions. We want families to be able to work with each other, and together, and local community support, and preventative services, to be able to address issues. This is not about punitive approaches from social services. So, that's the first element. In terms of thresholds for children's services, we would not be anticipating a huge number of referrals to us. There may be a small number of referrals that come through. What we know from other nations is that it will peak and then settle. We recognise that's likely to happen. Because we also know that this is actually quite a rare occurrence currently; this is not a defence that's being used with great frequency, this is not something that is happening. And if we look at the data, we know that the incidents of children, and the number of parents who now recognise this as an acceptable form of punishment, has steadily declined over the last 15 to 20 years. So it's diminishing as it is."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "So, on that one then, is there a need for legislation that will\u2014obviously there'll be resources for the Welsh Government and there'll be resources out of hours and things like that\u2014is there a need for legislation if, as you say, natural behaviour and the culture is changing? Let's be honest, as you've rightly pointed out, in social services\u2014I know in my own authority\u2014in your own authority, you're saying that even now you're working with the police, on systematic failings within the system."}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "Two things. Firstly, we want legislation that reflects our society\u2014we don't want the two to be out of kilter. That would be my first natural response: surely our legislation should be reflective of what our world is. It shouldn't be that we've got these rather confusing elements running in parallel, and that continues to perpetuate a lack of clarity and the ambiguity that we currently see. I think the other element is that, again, this is about potentially an accelerating of that awareness and that culture in our society, about how we care for our children. We've got there naturally; we've got there by the change that's happened in Wales over the last 15 to 20 years. What this does is to continue with that change and continue with that awareness and understanding of how we positively, from a strength-based approach, should care for our children, bearing in mind what's required of us in terms of the UNCRC."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay. Are there any comments from anyone else?"}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "Simply to say that I think that, in terms of that clarity for the very vulnerable children out there who are currently being assaulted\u2014seriously assaulted and abused by their parents, which goes on on a daily basis\u2014that is already covered by existing legislation. But at the moment, they don't know, because they could be being told\u2014and they probably are being told\u2014by their parents that's it's okay, that they can smack their child and that that's acceptable. They don't know the difference. A young child is not going to know that difference and there is confusion about what is\u2014. And if you asked most parents, and in fact lots of professionals, they would not be able to tell you, and probably most of you wouldn't be able to tell me exactly where is the threshold\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Yes, where's that line."}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "Well, at the moment, we don't know where that line is. That vulnerable child, at home, being abused by their parents, does not know where that line is. And they should know where that line is because then they can pick up the phone to Childline or they can talk to a professional and ask them where that line is. So, that would be a step forward. I do recognise, though, that what we don't want to do\u2014and the last thing any of us want to do\u2014is criminalise parents who are bringing up their children. That is why we're saying there needs to be an emphasis on the support programmes that are available to parents. And to be clear, there is no way that we want long-term involvement in any child's life, but particularly not in the lives of children who have been smacked by their parents. That is not going to be the result of this legislation, trust me, because we don't want to be involved in\u2014we haven't got the resources to be involved in children's lives. The social worker or the police officer\u2014if they become involved, then there would be a proportionate response to that, and there'll also be a test about whether or not that is progressed. So, if there is an allegation\u2014if this legislation is passed\u2014then that will be looked into and a consideration will be made about whether any action will be taken, and as with any allegation of the law being broken, there would be a proportionate response, as there is now."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "And the next question does relate to the practical response to that. Janet."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Yes. Can you outline the practical ways in which social services' interaction with parents will change as a result of this proposed law and do you envisage that all referrals to the police will be automatically referred to social services for an assessment? Who's going to make those decisions?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "That will be part of the implementation phase about that decision making. Interestingly, the number of referrals that we currently get from the police that we take absolutely no action on is extraordinary. So, we get a very, very large number of\u2014. It will be happening now; sitting in the civic centre in Newport City Council will be a whole host of social workers taking in the public protection notifications from overnight. It's 10 o'clock, so they're assessing them now, as we speak. And an awful lot of those will have no further action from the local authority."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "But will they be investigated?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "No. There will be no action. There are countless referrals made by agencies to local authorities that we take no action on."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "So, if there's an increase as a result\u00a0of greater awareness\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "What happens is there is a paper assessment of them. There's a look at what's happened, who's involved, what the police have reported, and there's work being done with the police to improve that. Because one of the things that we want to get to is actually where we're not using huge amounts of time to look at that, but what comes to us is what we act on. So, there is work going on with a number of police authorities to look at how you improve that process. But I suppose, to pick up, each incident will be looked at, each one will be assessed in a way that is proportionate, as Huw says, to look at what's happened and then investigated."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Sally, can you give us a couple of examples of what kind of things might have come in that you would then take no action on?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "We get countless referrals, for example, where there's been a domestic abuse incident overnight where a child wasn't present in the property and we then haven't taken action. It\u2019ll be where the level of harm that\u2019s perceived to happen to that child is below the threshold for intervention from children's services."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "I\u2019m pretty cynical about assessment, because, you know, I have people come in who are benefit claimants where, when they\u2019ve been assessed, the whole process has been very flawed and I\u2019ve had to fight and fight and fight on their behalf. So\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "Assessment processes within social\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "But if you're struggling now with those assessments\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "Assessment processes within social services are as laid out in the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014. So, we have within what we carry out, I suppose, that kind of initial look, that look at the information, what else do we know about that family\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "And are they qualified people that are doing this?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "Yes, absolutely."}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "And, in fact, in lots of places in Wales now, it\u2019s a multi-agency assessment. So, it\u2019s a joint assessment carried out with police professionals and health professionals."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "So, what proportion currently would you not be taking any action on, if a report came in of some domestic abuse where a child had perhaps been smacked?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "If something came in to us where a child had been smacked and there was something clearly there, we would look at it. We would clearly look at it and we would take some sort of action."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Even now, before the legislation?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Can you ask a final question? And I'm going to have to appeal for brief answers, because we've got a lot of ground to cover."}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "Just very quickly, there may be no action from social services, but it doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t offer support. So, the expectation is that support is offered in those circumstances from family support services, for example\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "Or prevention."}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "\u2014or prevention services. So, we would not say, if we were aware, for example, that there was domestic abuse at a home, \u2018There\u2019s no role for children\u2019s social services\u2019, because there may be an assessment that that child may not be at immediate risk of harm, but we would obviously recognise that there are causes for concern there and we would offer that support. So, just to be clear about that. And that\u2019s a process that happens in every social services department in the UK, and it\u2019s happened for a very long time, and, in fact, it\u2019s reflective of the legislation that you have laid down as Assembly Members."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "And are those services there, Huw? Because I\u2019m very acutely aware of the pressure on local government. Are the services there? Is there sufficient resource in things like Families First? Because what I\u2019m hearing on the ground is that eligibility is changing for even those preventative services."}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "There\u2019s not enough of those services, and, obviously\u2014you may have heard me saying this before\u2014I think we need to invest more in those services, and I hope you invest more in the services, because, obviously, prevention is better than cure. And those pressures that Sally talked about earlier are pressures that are not going away; they\u2019re only increasing by the day, actually, and I would want us to be able to offer those services now. Because that example of a child that perhaps is in a home where there is domestic abuse\u2014we\u2019ll probably have another referral off them in a couple of months\u2019 time, and that could escalate. And what I\u2019d rather do is provide support to that family and try and stop that family breaking down so that, in six months, we're not going back and saying that we've got to take this child into care because the domestic abuse has worsened and that child is at risk. But those services need additional investment."}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "I appreciate that time is of the essence, but, just really quickly in relation to that, it\u2019s not just social services. So, for example, there are developments like Encompass, which is a piece of work that is being rolled out across Gwent and across other areas, which is where the police automatically notify the school overnight of an incident, not expecting the school to do anything per se, but to be aware, to be able to offer care for that child."}, {"speaker": "Alastair Birch", "content": "Can I add to that? Operation Encompass I know in Gwent has been operational, and we started it in Pembrokeshire 18 months ago. We as a local authority\u2014and it\u2019ll be education that will contact the school around the domestic incident happening, and the school as part of that protocol will provide a level of universal service support for that child when they come in, before 9 o\u2019clock, so that professionals are aware of the needs of the welfare of that child at that point. So, you know, schools play a key role in the universal service of this and we work very closely with our social care colleagues on that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Janet, your last question, please."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "The Bill's explanatory memorandum refers to an estimate of 274 offences annually where lawful chastisement was used as a defence or considered. It says there is also potential to create extra demand on out-of-hours social services teams due to the time that the offences were reported, and in order to support safeguarding measures. Have you assessed how this Bill will impact on emergency and out-of-hours local authority services?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "We have considered that, and again I think that's something that we would very much want to look at as part of implementation. We have out-of-hours provision, we have emergency duty teams already across Wales that operate 24/7. There's no doubt that they exist and they work very closely with our police colleagues."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Are they overstretched at the moment?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "I think in the same way as all of social services is. If we were offered additional resource, we are going to take that. But are they working in a way that protects children day in, day out, and vulnerable adults? Yes, they are, and they will continue to do so."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you very much. We've got some specific questions now on the impact on education from Jayne Bryant."}, {"speaker": "Jayne Bryant AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. Good morning. Alastair, you've already mentioned about awareness raising and training, which will be key with educational professionals. How confident are you that teachers and others working in those educational settings will be clear about how to support the implementation of this Bill, if enacted?"}, {"speaker": "Alastair Birch", "content": "Training requirements for all professionals in education settings are clear. The universal tier 1 training is there, and all local authorities in Wales will implement that. In that level of general safeguarding awareness and training, the infinite emphasis is on the duty to report. That will remain the same. The thresholds for social care, that's their responsibility. That duty to report will always be there. It says in 'Keeping learners safe', which is the bible in terms of education professionals, that there's a responsibility on the professional to make that referral and for that universal service. So, the more specialist safeguarding leads within the schools, who have become highly skilled professionals in terms of understanding what might be significant harm\u2014because that's what we're talking about\u2014they understand the legalities when a referral needs to be made. There's always the collation of safeguarding information, where there might be just general concerns about neglect and other areas, which combined would create a picture that there might be significant neglect or significant harm to the child, and then that referral would be made to the child care assessment team or the police. So, that awareness\u2014it needs to be clear for educational professionals that that duty to report is always there. If they believe that that significant harm has happened then that report then goes to the child care assessment team. They will make the judgment on the threshold because they are the professionals. They have the multi-agency awareness of how that meets the threshold. But in terms of education, it'll be that awareness, making sure that there's clarity. If there's anything that professionals need to be trained additionally on, it'll need to go into 'Keeping learners safe', which at the moment is being rewritten. So, there would have to be some new possible information there relating to this. But as long as there's clarity, and once that implementation phase and the discussion has happened, as long as it's clear for professionals that the duty is always there and they feel a significant harm, then that report will always be there and will always need to be made. It's making sure\u2014and I'll echo what my colleague said, Huw\u2014that the services are key for families. Schools are absolutely fundamental in that support for the families. They have those relationships with the families. I know there was discussion around professional trust. On a daily basis, professionals are working on that trust with parents, because they are the ones that can engage with those families. The family support officers that are working on the ground with highly complex families, with multiple leads and supporting the children\u2014they are fundamental, and investment in that level of support would also help our colleagues as well. So, anything that's preventative. That is already happening in schools and is effective, and is shown to be effective, and has an evidence base\u2014we'd always support that that would continue to be invested in. So, that's really my answer."}, {"speaker": "Jayne Bryant AM", "content": "Okay. And you were saying about how important trust is as well, but do you think that there's a risk that those in education settings will have a key role in referring more parents to social services, which some have said could cause potential harm to relationships and cause mistrust?"}, {"speaker": "Alastair Birch", "content": "I don't think it's a matter of mistrust\u2014it's a matter of, you know, if a professional believes, based on the evidence that they have, because they're working with that child every day, that there is significant harm to that child, they are under a duty to report that to social care. So, part of the work is with families, and most of the referrals we make are with parental consent. That consent is a key element of this, and conversation with our social care colleagues is usually, 'You need to speak to the parents again and have a conversation with them.' Some of the NFAs\u2014the ones that don't get referred at threshold\u2014it will come back to school for, possibly, some support from the family or a team around the family or some other aspect. So, I don't think\u2014. The trust in the professionals\u2014it's actually more important that we are seen to be upholding our duties under the all-Wales safeguarding procedures. That's what engenders trust in a professional workforce."}, {"speaker": "Jayne Bryant AM", "content": "Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you very much. We're going to move on now to some questions about the importance of awareness raising from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Good morning. In looking at your written evidence, you say that we must make it very clear to parents, guardians and the public that this legislation is not trying to criminalise parents, and that is clearly very important for you. How do you think we should do that and who should be doing that work?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "I think that's really broad. Obviously, colleagues in education, colleagues in social care, colleagues in preventative services, but also Welsh Government and the National Assembly, in terms of those drivers in relation to that awareness raising are really, really key. If you look at some of the other campaigns that have been run, notably in relation to violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence, and echoing some of those building campaigns that have been done to raise awareness\u2014I think those would be really good models to begin to consider in terms of how this is taken forward with awareness. We also know that there are a number of routes that we can go through in terms of raising awareness. We have existing preventative services, we have all our universal services, we have the regional safeguarding boards and the national safeguarding boards. So, there are a number of avenues that we could then explore. In terms of not wishing to criminalise, I think if we look at the numbers, they are very, very small. And I think one of the things we need to hold on to in this is a sense of proportion about what is or isn't likely to happen once or if this Bill ever gets to the point of Royal Assent\u2014they are small numbers who currently use this defence. It is about that wider issue of awareness raising, and using all of those avenues will help us to do that in the broadest sense."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Do you, therefore, believe that this needs to be on the face of the Bill? That is, you don't say this in your evidence. I'd like to know your opinion on that. Scotland is going to be making it a duty for Scottish Ministers to raise awareness of the impact of the Bill. So far, the Welsh Government says that we don't need to do that in Wales. Wouldn't it make it clearer for you if it was a clear duty on the face of the Bill, for example as it was with the Human Transplantation (Wales) Act 2013? There was a duty in that Act for Ministers to promote transplantation. Surely, that awareness raising aspect would be clearer for everyone if it was on the face of the Bill. Do you have an opinion on that?"}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "Well, Welsh Government have given that commitment, and I know the Welsh Government honour every commitment that they make\u2014[Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "That's why I'm asking."}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "I don't know whether that is necessary\u2014I'm not a legislator. I think that there's obviously an inherent interest in Welsh Government raising awareness, because we have to raise awareness effectively for this to be successful, otherwise we will have parents who feel that they're being criminalised, and that's the last thing we want. I think it's worthy of consideration, but, as I say, I'm not a legislator or a lawyer, so I don't know what implications that will have long term. But to be fair to Welsh Government, I think that commitment is one that I'm sure will be honoured, because Welsh Government will want to make a success of this Bill if it does receive Royal Assent."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. But is it clear who would pay for all of that?"}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "I've suddenly changed my mind\u2014[Laughter.] I think it should be a duty on Welsh Government Ministers\u2014absolutely. I don't need to check with lawyers or legislators. There we go. And that's the WLGA position; I don't need to ask the other 21 leaders on that either. [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Wouldn't it make it clearer if there was a clear duty on the face of the Bill that awareness raising had to happen? It would be clearer, then, for local authorities and people in the front-line services what needs to happen."}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "I'm going to echo Huw. [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "I thought you might. Okay, fine."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. We're moving on now, then, to the contentious issue of resources and we've got some questions from Hefin."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Sally Jenkins, you said that the purpose of the Bill is to bring clarity and to remove what is a little-used defence. Isn't this an expensive way of doing that?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "I don't think so, no. I think that our children deserve the best legislation."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But introducing this legislation diverts finances from other areas of children's services\u2014or doesn't?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "Well, I would say, no, I don't think it will divert resources from children's services. Firstly, going back to the comment made, I think, proportionally, this is a very small number of cases. It's a very small number of existing cases that go through in terms of prosecution, or consideration for prosecution. We know that it's likely, from some of the work that we've already done, that it's not opening floodgates for a sudden sea of referrals to children's services\u2014that's not the way this is going to be, because the numbers are not out there because of the changes that have already happened in Welsh family life and Welsh society. So, I think as part of the implementation phase, we need to have a really clear understanding of the trajectory of those costs and what's likely to happen over the first six months, 12 months in terms of people's awareness and understanding and what is referred and how that's worked. But in terms of a huge number, no, I don't anticipate it being that."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But the costs wouldn't just be directed to the number of referrals and the number of cases raised, it's the cost around that, with training of staff, awareness\u2014all those extra additional costs that always come with legislation. Is it too much? Is it\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "No. And I agree with that\u2014that there clearly are\u2014but if you think, many of those things will be aligned with work we are already doing, but it brings a clarity to that work. So, our teachers, our social workers, our health workers, our police officers already get substantial training around child protection, around safeguarding, around adverse childhood experiences and around a trauma-informed approach to children. What this does is it layers a clarity on that. But rather than having a part of that training, which has to deal with this as an aspect\u2014that is no longer there; it is a clear message for all professions."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I fully appreciate that, and in the briefing note you've given us, you've outlined the pressures on social services. So, do you think this is another way of getting money into social services?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "If this was a way of getting money into\u2014. I can think of better ways, but I don't think this is it. No, I mean, I absolutely do not think that. I think this is a clear commitment to the rights of children in Wales; this is not about levering additional resources into children's services. Oh that it was so simple."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. And, do you think those costs are quantifiable?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "I think we are currently looking at work and are doing work across my own local authority and across two others to look at breaking down those costs, not just for local authority, but also for health, for police and for Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service Cymru. So, there is work currently taking place to try to quantify those costs."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. I think there was a bit about local authorities that Si\u00e2n\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Si\u00e2n Gwenllian has got a question on resources."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes, just to carry on from that, in a way. The explanatory memorandum that accompanies the Bill talks about the unknown costs for different agencies. You mentioned there that you're doing work around trying to identify some of those costs, but wouldn't it be useful if the explanatory memorandum did explain more about any unknown or unidentified costs, partly in order to calm some of those fears around that? Giving a title 'unidentified costs'\u2014is that good enough?"}, {"speaker": "Sally Jenkins", "content": "I think, clearly, that is a challenge, and that is work that we are participating in and are committed to completing with Welsh Government, to look at what those costs are."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And then they can be added into this."}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "I think this is where it would be helpful in the committee's deliberations and where our concern would be, because the reality is we're not going to know what the costs are until it's actually implemented, because we haven't implemented this before. And, therefore, I think there needs to be a commitment that, whatever the costs are, those costs are met because it is legislation that is being led by the National Assembly for Wales. And whilst we don't see it as levering in additional resources, we don't think it should be at the expense of current service provision to vulnerable families in Wales, and therefore it's important that it is properly and fully resourced."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "What I would argue on that is that you have to try and forecast. You say it's difficult to forecast how much this is going to cost, but we have to try and forecast that, and part of the argument for trying to have projections is to show that, perhaps, it's not going to cost that much, and that would add to the argument that, 'Okay, this is going to be fine to do and it's not going to put too much pressure on us'. Or we need to know that this is going to cost a lot to do it effectively, and therefore you have to make your argument, then, 'Well, we can't afford that, the money has to come from somewhere else.' We have to get the costs, surely."}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "Yes, and we will work very closely with Welsh Government to try and establish those costs as quickly as possible. There will be some costs that we will be able to identify. So, for example, a campaign, an awareness-raising campaign, the marketing, if you like, but some of the other costs will be more difficult to establish in terms of the resource implications for front-line workers. I expressed a view that we need to see some additional investment in some of those programmes that are not targeted directly at families that would be impacted by this but support all families across Wales that have different needs, and some of that provision is universal. Obviously, my view is the more we put into that, the better. So, there's no limit to that, but I suspect Welsh Government will take a very different view to that. But I think that is something where we need to see a commitment to some additional resources. But I don't put an upper limit on that, because I don't think there's an authority in Wales, and I don't think there's a charity, a police service or a health board in Wales that doesn't think that we need to do more of that and could offer more of that if the resources were available."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you all for attending and for answering all of our questions? It's been a really useful and informative discussion. As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again, all of you, for coming."}, {"speaker": "Huw David", "content": "And thank you for your questions and engagement.

To start with, Sian Gwenllian AM proposed questions like the strategy's evaluation, investment and principal. Dr Frank Atherton, at the same time, indicated that there was a n exact evaluation and the nation has already imposed tax on sugar and the first Minister will definitely be the ultimate man at the wheel. Then they paid much attention to existing data measuring child obesity and decided to put it in great use in tackling obesity. Meanwhile, the meeting talked about government legislation for some sort of things like restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks, and sports infrastructure in schools as part of efforts to make a healthy environment. What's more, they went into details on how healthy settings constructions and whom that would be the one to take responsibility.

Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Michelle Brown and Jack Sargeant; there are no substitutions. Can I ask if Members have any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. We'll move on, then, to item 2, which is our scrutiny of the 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' draft strategy, and I'm very pleased to welcome Dr Frank Atherton, the Chief Medical Officer for Wales, and Nathan Cook, who is the head of the healthy and active branch at Welsh Government. Thank you, both, for attending this morning. We're very much looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start by asking about the fact that 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' is an all-age strategy, really, and how confident you are that it will deliver for children and young people."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Well, we're very confident. I mean, it has to, quite clearly. We do need to think about the present generation, the problems faced by the current generation. We have high prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults\u2014we know that, and we can't walk away from that because that's translating into demand on health services. But we have to take a focus, a future generation's focus, almost, on the next generation. I don't write off the current generation, we can't afford to do that, but we do need to think about what can we do that would be different for the next generation so that they don't get into the sorts of problems that we're currently seeing with overweight and obesity. We know that the consequences of that for our young people are going to be enormous if we don't do something and something quite soon. We know that overweight children go on to become overweight adults, unfortunately, and that brings all the consequences of multiple disease issues\u2014diabetes is often cited\u2014cancer risk et cetera. So, we have to focus on children, and, in fact, during the consultation, we've been very clear that we need to engage with children and young people as well. Perhaps we'll get into that at some point, Chair, but, yes, I can give you that assurance."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. What my follow-up question, really, is: can you just tell us what kind of engagement you've had with children and young people to inform the draft strategy?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Well, Nathan may be able to influence some of the detail, but in broad terms, we have discussed with young people in a number of fora. In fact, I was delighted that we had a young person, Evie Morgan, a schoolgirl from mid Wales, who came to the joint launch on the consultation. She met the Minister there and gave a very good personal account of her views on obesity and overweight. We've been visiting a number of schools during the consultation process. I'm visiting a school, either this week or next week, at Treorchy, to talk with teachers and young people there. Obviously, we're hopeful that schools and young people will contribute to the consultation as well. So, we've had quite good input, I would say, from children and young people. There is always more we can do we and we want to hear those voices."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Cook", "content": "I was going to say, we've also had a session with youth ambassadors as well, and what we've actually produced for the consultation is not just the children and young people's version, but also a toolkit in terms of getting schools really engaged and involved in terms of the work that we want them to do to feed into this as well. So, we've already had some really good responses from a lot of youth group and schools already."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "And you've got a structured programme, have you, to roll that out? Okay. Thank you. We've got some questions now on leadership, and the first questions are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Good morning. I'll be speaking in Welsh. The Minister for health said yesterday, in answering a question from me on the Chamber floor, that you gave him advice not to have a target in terms of reducing obesity among children. Could you confirm that that's what your advice was and tell us why you don't think that a target is needed?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "My advice was not that we don't need a target\u2014we may well need a target, and that's one of the issues we need to consult on\u2014but that the target that had been adopted in England and in Scotland to halve the prevalence of obesity in children was more aspirational than deliverable, and that if we are to choose a target in Wales, then we need to balance deliverability with challenge. We need a challenging environment. So, there is something about performance management, because I would be looking to not just the health system but the health and care system and to public services boards to think about how they're delivering on this, and I think we can use targets to that. But they are one tool in the box that I would think we could use, and part of the consultation is to ask that question\u2014'If we are to go down a route in Wales of choosing a target, what might that look like?'"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. So, to be clear, you're not ruling out that maybe we would need a target."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "It's certainly something that we could consider in terms of the final strategy."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And is that your opinion too?"}, {"speaker": "Nathan Cook", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. Well, that is contrary to what I was told yesterday on the floor of the Chamber by the Minister, but there we go. I'm glad to hear that you're not ruling out having a target, because without a target, without something to aim for, how do we know that we're getting there?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "I think your point about evaluation is really important. Whatever we produce at the end of this process\u2014and we're looking to produce a final strategy towards the autumn\u2014we do need to have a strong evaluation. So, some metrics in there, it would seem, would be appropriate, but what those are, what the nature of those are, do we frame them as targets or ambitions\u2014that's the point we need to consult on."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. And the other point, of course, is the investment. If the Government is going to be successful in terms of the aim of reducing childhood obesity, then it needs to fund and support the actions. Have you made an assessment of the level of investment needed to implement this plan?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Resourcing will be important. We currently do make investments in a number of areas that relate to child health generally, and, of course, obesity and overweight in particular. So, the question of resourcing is important. Now, we can't quantify an absolute amount of resource that will be needed to deliver until we know exactly what's going to come out of the consultation and what actions we might want to deliver to a greater degree in Wales. A figure of \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million a year has been banded around as a broad kind of area of what we might need to invest, but that would need to be drawn from existing programmes. We need to look at existing programmes, how effective they are. Can we make them more effective? Can we get better value from them? And there may well be a case for new investment, and that's a question, of course, that would need to be discussed with Ministers when we're producing the final strategy."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Cook", "content": "But I think a key consideration as well is we already know there is investment across health boards in some kind of obesity-related services. So, I think what we really need to think about across Wales is how we can drive greater scale, how we can look at current programmes in terms of making sure that they're better evaluated, and how we can make sure that we're also drawing up on the existing resources and capacity out there as well."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And does the level of investment depend on what the target is\u2014what the goal is?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "I don't think you can necessarily just link the two. The issue of resourcing is one that's there irrespective of whether we choose to put a target in place."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "But how would we know that it's being used effectively if there isn't something to aim for?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Which brings you back to the question about evaluation. We need proper evaluation of the various programmes that we have."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes, but without a target, how can you properly evaluate? If you don't know what you're trying to do, how can you properly evaluate? Anyway, you're open to suggestions about having a target, which is great. Would you agree that Government could use the revenue that's being produced through the levy on soft drinks towards some of these efforts to\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Well, of course, there are some consequentials that are coming to the Welsh Government as part of the levy on sugary soft drinks. That funding, of course, is less than we had anticipated, and that reflects, actually, a success story because industry is reformulating, and so the amount of sugar in soft drinks is already starting to decrease, which is a good thing. But to your question:\u00a0should we use the funding? Well, of course we should use funding. I'm not personally in favour of hypothecation, I think I'm more interested in the totality of resource that goes into public health programmes than into marginal resource. There are, of course, a number of initiatives that we currently fund through the general revenue. And when I think about obesity, I don't just think about the relatively small marginal amounts of money that come in through whatever source, but I think about the totality of the \u00a37 billion we spend in health and social care and how we can divert and channel some of that towards broad prevention initiatives in general, and towards tackling being overweight and obesity in particular."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "You're saying that it's less than expected. Could you give us any kind of figure?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "You say that there is less money that's come in through these consequentials from the levy, can you mention some sort of figure?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "The figure that I have in mind is about \u00a356 million that's coming in in terms of revenue over a two-year period. But I'd have to confirm that with the committee. What the anticipated\u2014. When the sugar levy was first brought in, there was some modelling at UK level about what level of revenue that would bring, but it was based on the amount of sugar that was currently then in drinks and the fact that the sugar has reduced in drinks, I mean, the total amount available to the UK is less and hence our consequentials are less. Nathan may have some precise figures."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Cook", "content": "Yes, I was going to say, there was a mid-year report done where the levy has raised \u00a3150 million to date since coming into force in April, and the original forecast was \u00a3520 million a year. So, I think that shows the amount of work that's been done by industry around reformulation."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And the consequentials of that? That is the consequential\u2014\u00a3150 million."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Cook", "content": "On a UK level."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes, so what's the Welsh consequential?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Fifty-six."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Fifty-six? Gosh, that sounds a lot. Anyway, it's a good sum of money and you're talking about investing \u00a38 million to \u00a310 million. So, obviously, you know, we can be more ambitious because there is money in that pot if that money was ring-fenced for this particular scheme."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Well, the resource is going to be a real issue that we need to address, and I think as Nathan has said, there is funding of various initiatives currently in the system, and we need to look at that and make that as effective as possible. Will there be a need for some additional resource? There may well be, and that's a question that we'll have to look at in terms of the strategy when we develop it and have a discussion with Ministers about the level of resourcing."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Can I just ask on that before Si\u00e2n moves on? What assessment have you made of how that money is being spent in other UK nations? Because my understanding is that the money is being used in other UK nations to directly impact on obesity. Have you given any consideration to\u2014? As I understand it, that money now is being dispersed around a plethora of programmes, including the transformation programme, and what I found very odd, really, was vaccination, which is surely the core business of the NHS. Have you got any view on that?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "I'm not sure I understand your point, Chair, in terms of the link between the consequentials from\u2014. Are you talking about the consequentials from the sugar levy or are you talking about\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Yes, because in other nations, it is being used to directly impact on initiatives to tackle obesity, whereas, we've kind of put it here in Wales into the general pot and it's being used to fund a plethora of different things."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Well, that cuts to what I was talking about. My preference\u2014it's a personal view\u2014is that hypothecation doesn't really help us too much. I mean, what we need to look at is whether the programmes, the sorts of programmes that are being funded in England, or indeed in Scotland, are working effectively, and if they are, are they being delivered here in Wales? We have looked very carefully at the plans that England and Scotland have for tackling obesity and overweight, and we've made a comparison with what we're doing in Wales, and our ambition in Wales is to go further than those nations, in many ways. But I come back to the point that just linking the hypothecation of a relatively small amount of resource is likely to be less impactful than asking a question of public services boards and of the health system, indeed, about how much money, overall, are we putting into prevention."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "No, I recognise that, and I think we're talking about additional resource. Suzy."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I was just wondering whether you thought that there was a useful psychological link on the part of the public between saying, 'Here's a sugar levy', and 'It's going to be used to help children and adults stay healthier.' Going into a pot, it actually makes it quite difficult to explain the purpose of the tax in the first place. So, I take your overall point, but in terms of the people who we're trying to help in all this, actually creating a direct link might be quite helpful."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "You may be right. I'm not a behavioural psychologist. We'd have to ask\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Neither am I. I'm a person who eats a lot of sugar. [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Your point's taken."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thanks. Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "The last question from me, about partnership working. You're putting an emphasis on the whole-system approach in implementing the plan, how are you going to create a system that co-ordinates action and drives change across relevant partners, avoiding a situation where it's everyone's role, but nobody's responsibility? How are you going to avoid that?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "It's a very important question, and one of the four strands in the consultation is exactly related to that, around leadership and drive nationally. I'm not interested in producing a strategy that sits on a shelf. If you look around the world, there are plenty of obesity strategies. You may notice, by the way, that we've chosen not to talk about an obesity strategy but a healthy weight strategy, because I think having a positive construct is really quite important to us here in Wales. But leadership will be really important, and we will need some sort of structure to lead this, to provide oversight. I'm not a great believer in creating new structures, so we do need something that will give that drive, but the leadership comes from the top down. We need political commitment to this, and that's why I welcome the input from this committee. So, that needs to be assured. And then we need to make sure that the public sector generally is engaged in this, but it goes way beyond the public sector, of course, because we have to work with industry, and we have to work with communities, and we have to work with the public on this. So we need to think about our governance system for this and how we drive it forward. Interestingly, we had quite a large discussion two days ago between health and social care, but also involving the third sector and some members of the public, around how can we drive prevention more generally. It wasn't specifically on obesity, but of course obesity came up because it's such a pressing issue. This question of governance was discussed quite extensively, and we do have governance systems, of course, in Wales. We have public services boards, we have regional partnership boards, and how we can get those aligned behind this common agenda is really important. But I'd like to see\u2014and I know I'm a public health professional, so I know that only maybe 10 per cent, 15 per cent, possibly 20 per cent of what makes and keeps us healthy as individuals and as communities can be driven through the health system; but I would like the system to step up and take these kinds of issues more seriously as well. So I'd be looking for local leadership through directors of public health and indeed through chief executives to work with their public services boards on this. So, we'll need some sort of national oversight, absolutely, but we need local ownership and local leadership, too."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. We've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. Delivery of the plan will be led by a national implementation board that will be accountable to Ministers. Which Minister do you believe it should be accountable to, or, given the complexity of obesity, should the board be directly accountable to the First Minister?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Ultimately, the First Minister will be responsible for this and will want to have a strong oversight of this. It is often framed as a health issue, and the Minister, Vaughan Gething, has a strong personal commitment to this, I know. We've talked extensively with him and with sports and recreation colleagues about that, so there's a link there. It does cut across all portfolios, and so this is an issue that I have discussed with Cabinet, and that collective ownership is really important, and will be, because it can't just sit in one domain. I think what you do need to have is you do need to have a lead organisation or a lead ministry, and I would see health as\u2014I work within health, so I'm perhaps biased, but I would see health as leading this, but it needs broad ownership across Government."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "I know my colleague Si\u00e2n Gwenllian mentioned earlier targets and things, but I know in Wales we're not too good at collecting data. What data is currently available on childhood obesity and what metrics will be used to measure progress against the plan's objectives?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Well, of course, our main data source is the child measurement programme, which collects information on children entering school aged four or five. That's our main source of information. If we look at that data, it shows us\u2014. Well, I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics, but it'll be just under a third of children at that age who are overweight or obese\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Could I just ask\u2014sorry to interrupt\u2014how up to date is that?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "The last survey was just last year."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Cook", "content": "The data was published last week."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Yes, the lastest data was out last week."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "It is pretty up to date."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "So, it's pretty up to date, and what it shows\u2014. It's not getting radically worse\u2014there's always statistical variation in these things\u2014but it's not getting any better. And, for the first time last year, we did look at the question not just of children who were overweight or obese, but we actually singled out the proportion who are obese, severely obese. So we have a figure for that for the first time, which is about 12 per cent, which is quite shocking, in a way."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "It is shocking."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "So, that's our main source of information. Does that answer your question?"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Yes, but how will any gaps in your data be addressed?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Well, one of the questions that are often asked is: could we measure more on a longitudinal basis? By that I mean in England, for example, children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11\u2014at age 11 or 12., that kind of age group. And so you do have a longitudinal view over time of what's happening to children. I think that would be helpful to us in Wales, and it's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that. Obviously, that would have significant resource implications, not just for the funding, but also for schools and for the system to deliver it. But it's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation\u2014the point that was made earlier."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Cook", "content": "And the other data we do have is the millennium cohort study, which has been released, for 14 and 15-year-olds. That's going to be\u2014. We're starting to think about how we can utilise some of that data, looking at that longitudinal picture around children as well, which will be really helpful."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. You've answered my next question. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Can I just ask about the child measurement programme? The strategy commits to looking at whether we can have a second measurement taking place in Wales. Can you just tell us a bit more about your thinking on that and when you would see a second measurement taking place and how you would use that data?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "I touched on that just now, but personally I do think it would be helpful to have more information. It's always the case, There's always a trade-off between the cost of getting that information and the value of the information. So, the question of how it would be used would be really important. There is still a lot that we don't know. We know an awful lot about obesity and being overweight and the causes of it, but we don't really have a very clear understanding, in Wales at least, of the point at which children start to become overweight. Although we know that overweight children tend to go on to become overweight adults, we don't know what proportion of them between school entry and later teenage years\u2014what those changes are. So, it would help us to have some better understanding, which would help to direct some of our initiatives. I'd be generally supportive of the principle. We'll wait and see what comes out in the consultation, and it's something that we need to give thought to,\u00a0 but we do have to trade off the additionality of what the information would give us with the cost of doing that, of course."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. We've got some questions now on healthy environments from Dawn Bowden."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. In the draft plan, some of the measures in there suggest legislating for restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks, and that sort of thing. Do you think that, if we go down that road, there's going to be time within this Assembly to introduce such legislation? And, if not, what do you think might be the timescale for such legislation?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "It may well be that there are things in Wales that we might wish to legislate on, and you've mentioned two of them, and they're good examples. We would, obviously, need to undertake quite detailed consultation on those and, in a way, we need to mirror what's happening in England and in Scotland\u00a0to some degree around the consultations they're having on energy drinks. We also need to influence the issues that are not devolved to us and we seek to do that. As to your question of legislative time, I'm not really in a position to answer that. What I could say is that legislation may well be one of the outcomes of the consultation. There may well be things that we wish to choose to legislate on. The timing of that will have to be subject to other pressures, and I come back to the point that legislation, of course, is one of the tools that we've got\u2014we need to deploy them all."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Sure, I understand that, that you could do other things. I know\u2014. We've heard from the Government, on other calls for legislation, that the programme's very tight, certainly for this term, so I was just wondering whether we might get that in, but okay. If I turn now to the planning system\u2014and this might not be something that you have great deal of knowledge of; I'd just welcome your view on this, because, when we discussed with stakeholders, we talked about whether the planning system, for instance, could be used to, as an example, restrict hot food takeaways around schools and so on. Would that be a measure that you would support, something like that?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "I think it's definitely something we want to look at and, of course, that question is asked in the consultation, so we would like to know people's views on that. It's an interesting one. I think there is a question\u2014a really important question\u2014about how we can use the planning system more effectively. I've discussed with Nathan on a number of occasions, with planning colleagues in Welsh Government and in local authorities, about the art of the possible, let's say. There may be things that we could think about and we want to get those ideas through the consultation. The specific question around takeaways, particularly takeaways near schools, is often asked. I was very interested to see, up in the north-east, some time ago, that one of the local authorities up there did put a moratorium on the opening of new fast-food venues near to schools, or indeed in areas where levels of obesity and overweight were particularly high. I understand London is now\u2014some London boroughs are now\u2014experimenting with that as well. So, that gave me comfort, because maybe there are powers within local authorities that can be used more effectively.\u00a0I think my view at the moment is that the jury's kind of out on whether those are effective and how effective they're going to be. But the fact that we have some initiatives around the UK does give us an opportunity to study that and to learn from experience perhaps and then, if it is shown to be beneficial, to think about that here in Wales, yes."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Sure, because it will only be one of a suite of measures anyway. Of itself, it wouldn't address the problem, but, added to other initiatives, I guess it would. Can I just ask you briefly, then, about community sport infrastructure and, in particular, of new schools? So, Welsh Government, as you know, has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme. What we heard when we spoke to stakeholders recently, particularly headteachers, was that, in some of the new schools that have been built, we haven't had changing rooms and toilet facilities, for instance, built into the new buildings. So, if we're going to try and utilise these buildings for general community activity to get kids and the wider public, actually, more active, do you think that's something that we ought to be building in? Again, not your particular direct area of responsibility, but something that you might have an input into, is that, when we're developing schools, we should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public. Is that something that you would be prepared to make a recommendation around?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Well, it's certainly a fascinating area and one that I think has a lot of potential. It goes\u2014. You're right to raise it in the context of schools, and I can understand why this committee would, but I think it goes beyond that, actually, into all developments in the public sector and how they're developed and whether we're building health into our environment, which perhaps is your starting point. One of the things that I was really pleased to see in terms of the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 that was passed a couple of years ago was the use of health impact assessment as a tool, and we're still working on how that will inform policy and how that will be applied in issues such as policy decisions through Government, but also in more downstream issues about how we create the public infrastructure that the public can and should be using. And so I would like to see the use of health impact assessments to a much greater degree to inform those kinds of decisions. If you apply that kind of lens and you take the point, which is inherent in your question, I think, that schools are not just for kids, they're for communities, then you would\u2014it would lead you to a conclusion that you would perhaps design and build them in a different way. So, on a personal basis, I would certainly support your view that we should be looking to use the sports environment in schools in the same way as we use leisure centres. There are all kinds of barriers in there, and I understand all of that, and it's not really my field, exactly as you say, but, as a matter of principle, I think it's a good one to pursue."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. And widening it out to other public services buildings as well."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Indeed."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Yes. Okay. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We're going to move on now to talk about how we create healthy settings. I've got some questions from Suzy Davies."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you very much. Yes, perhaps if we could just stay in this area of education just for a moment, I think we all agree that healthy habits acquired early on probably tend to last quite well, so I wonder if you can tell us a little bit about the healthy and sustainable preschool scheme and whether you think some timescales should be made public about what you expect the achievements from that scheme to be. But, in particular, I was struck with what you said about local leadership, and I just want you to bear that in mind in answering the next question, which is about the foundation phase. You're probably aware that this committee has heard from various school leaders that they're struggling in some cases to meet the ratio of staffing for the foundation phase, which potentially compromises the purpose of it in terms of physical activity.\u00a0I'm just wondering how the strategy development board is considering that at the moment. Is it something that's come on the radar for the board? Is it something you're thinking about? And, if so, who do you think should be responsible for pinning that down a little bit? Because this is education, not health, and\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Well, look, I've got to confess to you, I'm not an educationist, and so the question on staffing numbers in schools is not one that I have been asked to give a deal of consideration to, and it hasn't really been discussed, I don't believe, in the context of development of the strategy. If there is a specific point around that that the committee would like to make in terms of a response into the consultation, which I presume you'll be making, then we'd be happy to consider that. As to healthy preschools, I don't know, Nathan may have some view on that. I've not been closely involved with the work. We have standards and we perhaps need to think about how we tighten those standards and how we\u2014enforce isn't the right word, but how we implement and make sure that those standards are properly implemented, because you're absolutely right to say that habits are developed early in life. That's in the preschool; it's also in the home of course, and then later in the school. So, we do need to look at all of those as settings and are there more things we can do within those settings to drive healthier behaviours\u2014that's exactly why we need the consultation."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Cook", "content": "But I would say, through that scheme as well, we've really got a really good bank of preschools that are actually doing some really great work in this area as well. So, I think the more we can understand the successes that some of those environments are having\u2014you know, how we can roll those out and work across other settings to create that wider impact as well is going to be really important."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. What I'm thinking about is expectations at that level will be expectations at a slightly older level, which will be contained within the foundation phase. And while you're quite right\u2014obviously, parents have a role in this, or families\u2014there will be, particularly with the introduction of the new curriculum, certain expectations on schools to provide not just healthy environments but to actively work towards well-being and healthy weight in children and things. And that's why I asked you about local leadership, because, if it fails for reasons that have nothing to do with the plan at foundation phase, it's going to fail further up the school years as well. I think it might be something that the board might want to consider here, because at some point there'll be an accountability question and we will want to know how 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' fits in with the new plans for the new curriculum, and whether it's merely persuasive and influential or whether it has the weight to place some obligations on school leaders about what they do in their schools. So, this connection, I think, is quite an important one, and, if the strategy development board could consider that, I think it would be very helpful, because this doesn't exist in a vacuum."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Well, I'd certainly be delighted to\u00a0take that back and we can look at it in terms of how we move from the consultation into the final strategy. It's certainly a point we can try and look at."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Because we will want to know who to ask: 'you're the accountable person\u2014why has something worked, or not worked?' We will need to know that at some point."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Just building on Nathan's point, some of the schools\u2014I know it's schools rather than the preschools, and I take your point, but some of the schools we've been working with have absolutely brilliant models of good practice and good local leadership. I remember the Minister actually at the launch, and one of the schools was represented there, and they presented\u2014the school came and some of the children came and presented\u2014to the whole audience about the activities that they were undertaking in their school around physical activity and on healthy eating, and it was such a model of good behaviour the question was, 'Well, why not everywhere?', so that probably speaks to your question."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, well, thank you for that commitment anyway."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "And have you had any discussions, then, with education officials around things like teacher training and CPD, because you'll be aware the Health and Social Care Committee has made a number of recommendations in this area? It's crucial that we skill up the staff to develop these things in an appropriate way, isn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Well, we certainly discuss with education colleagues in Welsh Government. There's more we need to do in terms of that, because you're absolutely right: there's something about building the whole of the workforce\u2014education is really important, but elsewhere as well; it's about how do we really make every contact count, you know, that construct. So, everybody who's working in the health and social care system should have a role in this; everybody who works in education, whether it's the old\u2014. Do we still have dinner ladies? Or teachers, you know, they have a role to play in supporting children to be as healthy as they possibly can. And, actually, I see them, Chair, as a really essential part of the public health workforce."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Suzy, are you going to do your curriculum one?"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, I've bound it in together, but that final point you make about teachers being part of the answer to this, they're already under a range of pressures: is it fair to make them accountable for whether this works or not? Or should that local leadership lie somewhere else? I don't expect you to pin down a person today."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "I wouldn't like to blame a teacher or performance manage them on the proportion of their children in their class who are overweight. That would clearly be nonsense, wouldn't it? But they are part of the solution, and so the accountability lies further up the chain, doesn't it? The question I think we would have, and public services boards might well ask, and the local education authorities may well ask, is: how effective is any particular school at driving forwards these healthy behaviours?"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. I'll leave some questions for Hefin."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Hefin."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Is that all right, Chair?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "You've got the floor, Hefin."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. You make a commitment to embedding physical activity at an early stage in primary school education. What would that look like?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Just in terms of the physical activity, I have to say it's a really important dimension and we need to move further on. We know not enough of our children are physically active and they're not meeting the various guidelines, so it's really important. It doesn't actually have as much of an impact on weight as the dietary issue. I'd just say that. It's really important for all sorts of reasons. It does have an impact on healthy weight, but it has a huge impact in terms of socialisation, in terms of mental health issues, et cetera, you know. So\u2014I'm sorry, I've lost track of your question."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Cook", "content": "I'd just say that one thing we have got in train is, obviously, Sport Wales, Public Health Wales and Natural Resources Wales\u2014we have them working together as a collaborative at the moment to look at how their joint delivery on physical activity can be taken forward more efficiently. So, one of the things they are looking at is obviously the schools programmes they do through eco-schools, the Welsh network of healthy schools and the sports programme to really think about that physical activity and how we can have better join up in terms of the programmes that we're already delivering as well."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "With that in mind, I'm going to confess to you, chief medical officer, I did anything in school I could to avoid physical education lessons. I hated it. I didn't feel engaged with it. Yet, two weeks ago, I played for the Assembly rugby team\u2014I wanted to get that in. The school sports survey, that would suggest that we're still not hitting those targets with children. How can we get children more engaged with physical education in ways that\u2014? I felt completely alienated in school."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Well, you're right, and many people go through that same journey and come to physical activity later in life, and that's great if they do that. The sad reality is that many people don't, and we also know that there are issues around the dropping off, particularly for girls, of physical activity towards the teenage years. So, there are specific moments that we need to understand. We do have a lot of information about these kinds of things. Public Health Wales is very good at collating the information. We do need to turn that into programmes. I mean, at the heart of it, it's about making sports and physical activity enjoyable and attractive to people. Sometimes that's easier, I sense, for boys than for girls, but we need to tailor things to different audiences."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Yes, that's the trick, isn't it? It's about finding out what children enjoy doing. That could be quite a wide and varied range of things. Is that the key?"}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "It's not all about organised team sports."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Yes. As Dawn said, it's not just about organised team sports. There are some very individual activities you could do."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Absolutely, yes. And that's where I think\u2014. I'm delighted that Sport Wales has moved beyond. It's not just about elite sports; it's about getting everybody engaged and active in sports, and that partnership with Public Health Wales that Nathan talked about is really important, because we need a population approach to driving physical activity."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, do you think, with that in mind, we need statutory guidance for schools on physical education?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Again, I'd look to the consultation as to whether there was an appetite for any kind of guidance. It may well be that that is something that could be considered."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. And finally, with regard to free school meals to all pupils in primary and secondary schools, do you think that extending that to all pupils would be beneficial in providing a more varied diet for pupils?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "I don't have a personal view on that. I think it's the quality of the food that kids are getting, whether that comes from home or through school, and whether it's free or whether it's paid for. I think it's the quality of the food that we need to focus on. The question of children being hungry at school is a really important one and needs to be addressed at a national level. I think that's a\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, you think that's more about the provision of food for those who might not have access to it than providing a varied diet."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "I think it's important that children have access to food, absolutely, if that's your question, but we also need to look at the quality of the food and what's in that food offer."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But you don't necessarily think universal provision would\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "I don't have a clear view on that. I know there's a larger debate about that."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "I've got some supplementaries from Janet and then Suzy."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Yes. I've been around some amazing schools in my own constituency, where they've got proper canteen facilities for pupils and really, really good produce in the meals. However, there's probably only a third having school meals; the rest are packed lunches. And, to be honest, I've been very surprised and shocked at what I've seen of the quality of the food in the packed lunches. Nobody can really police, and I wouldn't want to see parents being policed over what goes in a packed lunch, so if there is data out there to suggest that there's a larger percentage of parents providing packed lunched that are really not good at all, then there is some merit to be said for what Hefin is\u2014. Me, personally, I'd love to see the introduction of universal school meals. I think it's been a very retrograde step, going backwards. Would you be willing to carry out any research?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "So, I mean, your point about food that's brought in in the packed lunches is a really important one, and I've talked to some headteachers as well about this. We could go down a route of guidance and prohibition, but that gets you into the role of nanny in chief and I don't really see that as my role or Government's role, and I don't think it's effective either. Do you remember\u2014? You must have seen on tv\u2014I think it was in Scotland; I don't know if it's happened in Wales\u2014parents pushing the fish and chip packets through the school railings. We don't need to get into that. What I have seen, though, is some really good innovative practice in schools where, for example, they reward children for bringing the healthy options. Schools can give guidance to parents about what would be a healthy lunch and what sort of things might be expected to be seen in the lunch box. And you can reward children, and children do respond to rewards. So, I've seen some of those approaches that have transformed, actually, the offer of what comes in school boxes. But I think just banning chocolate bars and crisps in the packed lunch is unlikely to be successful."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "We can't do that. So, my point to the question was: isn't there some merit, perhaps, about all children being equal and eating similar good-quality food in schools?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Yes. That gets you back to the question about universal school meals."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Perhaps some of that \u00a356 million sugar tax, even. Who knows?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Suzy."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes. Mine is just a short question. The draft plan commits, doesn't it, to updating the healthy eating in schools regulations\u2014the 2013 regulations? I appreciate this is a consultation, but what is it that needs changing in those regulations at the moment, just to give us a bit of steer?"}, {"speaker": "Nathan Cook", "content": "It's mainly on sugar content, so, obviously, they don't adhere to current Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition guidelines around sugar levels. So, what we'd want to consider is, you know, what we need to be careful of is unintended consequences of changing that, as well, if you see a shift to more kids bringing in school packed lunches as well. So, I think we want to consider the best way of doing that and consider through the consultation how we can go about it."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "All right. So, it's very pertinent to Janet's question, in that way. Okay, so it's mainly about sugar, but it could be about other things as well. Okay. Thanks."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. The next questions are from Janet anyway; firstly, on the clinical obesity pathway."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "The 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' plan commits to a review of the clinical obesity pathway. What are the time frames for this review, and what do you think are the basic essentials of a clinical obesity pathway for children and young people?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "We do have a pathway for managing overweight, and that's been in place since about 2010, I believe, and we do need to bring that up to date in terms of current knowledge and experiences. We've challenged Public Health Wales; we've asked Public Health Wales to undertake a review of that pathway, and they are going through that process now. I'm not sure of exactly the time frame that we have given them for that."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Cook", "content": "We were asking them to review the pathway before we launch the final strategy in October because, obviously, what we want is for that to inform what that final strategy looks like. So, we'll be looking probably early autumn for them to report back on that."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "The second point of your question about what are the essential elements, I mean, they are already there; we need to tweak them and we need to make sure that they're properly delivered. But it's a tiered approach, so, having access to information through schools and through communities and into families is part of the first step of that. And then, if children are overweight, it's a question about how they're identified. There are questions about the ability of the public to recognise large children, so there may be an issue there. But when children are running into issues around weight, what kind of interventions can be put in, either through primary care or through communities through health visitors, et cetera? And then of course we do have\u2014and we've started to shine a light on this, haven't we\u2014the very overweight children. I don't think we have enough in the way of targeted support to be able to support those. There are programmes available, but they're perhaps not universally provided. So, I think there's something about looking at our whole pathway, mapping out what the current evidence now shows us is needed, and then thinking about what is our provision in Wales and what do we need to do to bring that up to the level of the places that are the best."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. The draft plan recognises the importance of the first 1,000 days, but it doesn't appear to include any new proposals to help parents to enable lifestyle changes. It lists existing initiatives, such as the Healthy Child Wales programme and breastfeeding action plan. Are you satisfied that the draft plan does enough to address the influence that family and parents have on children's healthy weight behaviours, particularly in the first 1,000 days?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Well, the first 1,000 days are really critically in shaping lives, as I'm sure you'd agree. We are absolutely open to any other suggestions that the public or this committee have as to what more we can and should do. There are a number of things, the sorts of programmes you've mentioned, that I think could be more effective. We're currently looking at breastfeeding because it starts before birth, actually. We know that children who are breastfed are less likely to suffer from obesity in childhood and, indeed, to go on to be obese adults. So, we do need to go further on that. We do have some programmes\u2014Healthy Working Wales, et cetera\u2014that need to be improved. If there are other interventions in other areas that we need to take, then we'd be delighted to hear what they are, but those are the ones that have jumped out so far."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Cook", "content": "Can I just say\u2014? One of the proposals we're looking for is, obviously, we know that during pregnancy it's a really critical time when we can actually look to work with mothers. We know from looking at some of the behaviour change that it's actually a really critical point when new mothers really start thinking about their lives, wanting the best for their child and their families. So, what we are thinking about is how we could develop some kind of approaches to that going forward. But we know our Healthy Start scheme is also a good lever for us, just in terms of how we can look to improve that kind of dietary offer at the earliest stage as well."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. Finally, we know that for some families day-to-day challenges can make it difficult for them to make healthy choices, particularly for those on lower incomes and/or maybe using food banks. Could the Welsh Government take bolder action to better support low-income families to eat healthily?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Well, you've touched on a really important point about inequalities because overweight and obesity is not evenly distributed across our population. It absolutely is more prevalent in more socioeconomically deprived communities, and that's something that should really concern us all. So, it gets you to questions of availability of fresh food and produce; it gets you to questions of formulation of products and whether value brands are less healthy than more premium brands. So, it cuts across all of those issues that we talked about in terms of settings and in terms of environment earlier. There is something about the affordability of good-quality healthy food that we need to think about. We do need to think in broad terms\u2014broader terms than just obesity, but we do need to think in broad terms\u2014about how we create a society where families have the wherewithal to lead healthy lives, and that gets you to really important questions about the minimum wage and income poverty. There's no doubt in my mind\u2014I'm a public health professional\u2014and there's no doubt in my mind that economic success and health success go hand in hand. So, you speak to a very deep question there. In terms of what we can do through this particular consultation, there are some things in there about providing better access, but without tackling some of those deeper determinants of health, their impact will necessarily be limited."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Just finally from me, then, you referred earlier to the importance of making every contact count, but some stakeholders have told the committee that they struggle to do that because of difficulties in availability of people to refer to. Is that a situation that you recognise and what, really, can we do to improve that situation?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "Well, it depends what you mean as to where to refer to. So, the health system obviously needs to respond to this issue. What we're seeing across the NHS is a gradual transformation in primary care so that primary care is no longer about going to see your GP, it's about going to see a practice where you have a range of health professionals. Would I like to see more dietetic support, for example, in that setting? Absolutely I would. I think we need to think in terms of that pathway that we were talking about earlier, about access to that kind of advice and support, which can head off people getting into problems and kids getting into problems with weight issues. So, that question of redesign of the pathway really speaks to, I think, your point about, 'Well, where do people go when they have problems with their weight?' That's true for adults and it's true for children as well."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you both very much for your attendance? It's been a really productive session. We appreciate your time. You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy in due course, but thank you again."}, {"speaker": "Dr Frank Atherton", "content": "We'll do that. Thank you, Chair, and thank you to the committee, because getting some input into the consultation from children's perspectives, this would be one of the routes we would absolutely welcome. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you very much. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee on CAMHS tier 4 provision.

Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee this morning. I've received no apologies for absence. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Item 2 this morning is our scrutiny session on Estyn's annual report 2018-19. I'm very pleased to welcome Meilyr Rowlands, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, Estyn; Jassa Scott, strategic director at Estyn; and Claire Morgan, strategic director at Estyn. Thank you all for attending. We're looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. We'll go straight into questions from Suzy Davies."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Bore da. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for the papers upfront, in which you say that the most striking feature of the education system, looking forward, of course is the curriculum and the change that that's bringing. How can we be sure that, during this period of change, standards don't slip? And also, from the point of view of scrutiny, will we be back in a situation where we're being told, 'You can't compare one set of results against the previous year's results, because of the nature of the change'?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Bore da, bawb. Thank you for the invitation to come here. I think that's a good question. I think any kind of major educational reform has got risks attached to it, particularly if those changes were made too quickly. I think this process of reform has been going on in the background for a few years now, so I think there is a track record of standards and provision not slipping. We've seen small incremental improvements. So, overall, I think we can be fairly confident that standards won't slip during this period of preparation."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Can I just ask: is that based on your evidence around primary schools, where the sort of ethos that we've seen in the curriculum has been already articulated through the foundation phase?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "The track record I'm talking about is across the board, so it's very difficult to think of anything that's actually got worse over the last three or four years, so it's difficult to say that standards of provision is slipping. It might not be improving as quickly as we would like, but the purpose of major curriculum and, more generally, educational reform is to make sure that we do get a more substantial sort of improvement. I think we should congratulate the profession for the work they've been doing. A large number of schools and teachers and leaders have been part of preparing the new curriculum and all the associated work, as well as doing the day job. I think their commitment and their engagement with curriculum reform, and engagement with wider education reform, is to be congratulated. So, I think going forward, we must make sure that that is continued; that this process that's called co-construction\u2014engaging with the profession, making sure that they're behind all the changes\u2014continues. I think that's what's going to make sure that we don't see any slippage."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, and on that point of comparing year on year, we will be able to make those comparisons legitimately then?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes, certainly, in terms of our inspection outcomes and our inspection work, yes."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. That's great, thank you. Can I just ask you then about the difference in preparedness between primary and secondary schools, which I've just mentioned previously, and also what your views are on the impact of funding for schools on that as well? Because we're in a situation where a number of primary schools have got surplus funds, sometimes that's because of end of year additional funds just being magicked up, but there is a serious worry that so many secondary schools are in deficit and that, overall, secondary schools are in deficit. Is there a correlation between those two positions, that secondary schools may be less ready for this than primary schools?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think it's probably true to say that secondary schools have a greater challenge than primary schools generally in terms of preparedness for the new curriculum. I think that's why we welcomed the phasing in of the new curriculum. With any sort of education reform, you've got that danger of people wanting to see change as soon as possible on the one hand, and on the other hand you need time to pilot things, to make sure that people have the right professional learning and make sure that there's opportunity for evaluation and thinking and so forth. So, we've got to get that balance right."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Sorry, that could be difficult to do if a school doesn't have money to create that space, couldn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes. You raised two issues, I think. One, about the difference between primary and secondary: I think what I'm saying there is I think the fact that the new curriculum is going to be brought in for all the years in primary, but it's going to be phased in year by year for secondary is a recognition of that difference. In terms of funding, probably everyone in this room, and certainly me included, would like to see more money for the education system\u2014any educationalist would like to see that. But, you know, that is a decision for local and central Government to decide how much they can afford. I think there is an argument for saying that the funding has become more challenging for schools over time."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Can I ask, just to keep it on track, are you finding that that's having an impact on secondary schools particularly\u2014their ability to make space to get their heads around the curriculum?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I don't think you can make that straightforward correlation. But if you do look at surpluses and reserves, they have been more or less constant for primary schools over a long period of time, but they have declined for secondary schools. So, I think there probably is an argument for saying that we need to look at the funding of secondary schools in particular because, overall, they're in deficit now. So, I think there is an argument for looking at that. The other thing that's worth saying about funding is that even a small decrease in real terms can be disproportionately time consuming to manage. So, you know, if you have a large school and you have to maybe make one member of staff redundant, it can have a real big effect on the morale in the school. But also the time it takes for the headteacher and the senior staff to make those decisions can take their eye off the educational ball because they're looking at these financial and staffing issues."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Si\u00e2n might develop that a little bit further on. The final question from me is: there's a general concern about the number of teachers that we have in the system at the moment, particularly at secondary level and in particular subjects as well. How do you think we can improve that? What impact is it likely to have on the ability of secondary schools to really get a grip on this?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Obviously, the most important resource for the education system is the teachers. So, it is a concern that recruitment is getting more and more difficult and that targets for initial teacher training are not being hit. And we're not seeing them hit, if I remember correctly, even in primary, let alone secondary. So, there is a challenge, and I think we've got to look at this in the round. We've got to make sure that we have both a long-term strategy and a shorter term strategy for this. So, long term, we've got to make sure that education is an attractive option for young people and more mature people to want to go into. So, that is partly to do with workload and staff well-being. I think there's a general acceptance now that that needs to be higher up on the agenda, that people need to take that seriously, and there's work going on regarding the workload issue."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I suppose what I'm coming to, and I will finish with this, Chair, is, we're asking our existing workforce to undertake a fair bit of continuous professional development\u2014let's call it that\u2014in order to get ready for this curriculum when they've barely got time for lunch as it is. Do you think that's going to have an impact on the ability of secondary schools to get to grips with this, albeit that there'll be a phasing in?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes. I think it will have an effect, but I think it'll have a positive effect. I think the new curriculum, one of the things about the new curriculum is that it re-professionalises the profession. It gives back agency and ownership to teachers. I think it's really important. And one of the reasons why teaching maybe hasn't been that attractive a profession is that teachers in the past have just been delivering a set curriculum, and now they've got a much more creative part in deciding for themselves how to teach something and what to teach. So, I think that is a very important part of attracting intelligent people into the profession.  There are short-term things we need to do, of course, as well. I think we need to have a much more varied set of routes into teaching, so I welcome some of the part-time Open University courses, for example. So, there are lots of ways\u2014we were talking about maybe converting people from primary into secondary, particularly in Welsh-medium, where there's a shortage. So, all those kinds of varied routes, I think, into teaching, are important as well."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Degree apprenticeships, potentially."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes, I think it's well worth exploring that. Yes."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Lovely. Thank you. Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Si\u00e2n Gwenllian now has some questions on secondary schools causing concern. Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes. Just before going on to that, just to pick up on that last point that you made about the shortage of teachers and losing teachers during the first year of their training. Has Estyn done any themed work on that particular issue, or do you intend to do anything on that? Also, looking at the financial incentives and how they compare with the situation in England, for example; do we need, perhaps, to think about financial incentives, not just for specific subjects, but for going to schools where there are particular issues, perhaps?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, yes, there are currently discussions ongoing between us and the Government about working in those early years for teachers. It's possible that we will be undertaking work in the near future on that. I know that Professor Mick Waters is looking at this currently, and we've had the discussion with him. And I think we would welcome the opportunity to look at this particular period. Now, we are, of course, looking at initial teacher training, but we haven't looked at the first couple of years for many a year."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Right, thank you very much. And for your information, I've commissioned a piece of work on that particular issue, and that work will be published in due course. So, I hope to have a discussion with you about that."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Thank you very much. Yes."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "In terms of the secondary schools, that\u2019s where the problem lies, isn\u2019t it, rather than the primary sector. How much of a concern is it to you that children\u2019s chances of going to a secondary school that is good or better appear to be 50:50, and that, indeed, over 10 per cent of secondary schools are judged to be failing and 12 per cent are under Estyn review? How much of a concern is that to you?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, it is of concern to us, of course. I hope that we will have an opportunity to talk about the positive aspects of the education system in Wales, because there are a number of good things we can report also. The primary sector, the special sector, post-16\u2014there are many sectors that are doing well, and I think a story that's particularly positive this year is that we have seen pupil referral units improving. We have seen examples of excellent practice in that sector for the first time in many a year, and we've also seen excellent practice in independent special schools, which is also a sector\u2014. Because these are two sectors where there are very, very vulnerable children in attendance. So, I think that's very encouraging. But, you're right, of course, the biggest concern for the system, I would say, is secondary schools, and that is an issue of leadership, and also of the quality of the teaching and learning. Those are the recommendations that we make most often in our inspection reports. So, I believe that there is a need to find a long-term solution, as I mentioned previously, and also a short-term solution to this problem. In the long term, to improve the quality of teaching and learning\u2014well, that\u2019s the main aim of the new curriculum. So, I am confident that that strategy is the right strategy. It will take time, as we mentioned previously; it will take longer in secondary schools, and that's for a number of reasons, and I have discussed the challenges that are additional for secondary schools in previous annual reports. So, there are many reasons why secondary schools find it more difficult, possibly, than primary schools. The children themselves are older and they have greater challenges. Life is more complicated for them, possibly. It\u2019s more difficult to engage with the parents of older children than younger children, and that\u2019s an important factor. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I believe it\u2019s important that we do have community schools that ensure that the parents are part of the school\u2019s life and take an interest in the education of their children. We also know that qualifications take a very prominent role in secondary schools\u2019 mindsets, and, in some cases, perhaps excessively so. So, we need to ensure that those qualifications are reformed as a result of the reform of the curriculum, and, of course, Qualifications Wales is carrying out that work currently. And also, we need to change the measures that we use to measure the schools\u2019 successes. Now, there is work ongoing on that as well. But there are all kinds of variations and differences between the primary and secondary sectors. In primary schools, for example, the greatest and most obvious difference, I would say, is that you\u2019ve got one teacher who looks after a child for a whole year, and that teacher can identify the needs of the pupil very well over a period of time, getting to know the child and, possibly, the family very well. It\u2019s much more complicated for secondary school to do that; there have to be systems put in place for that. So, there are many long-term things that we need to respond to. But in the short term, what is important is that those schools that cause concern receive much more support, and that is why I am glad and do welcome what's being piloted currently, which is a system of supporting these schools, the multi-agency approach, that is. So, that is something that we have been calling for for quite a long period of time and piloted ourselves a few years ago. So, I'm very glad that we are doing this in secondary schools throughout Wales. I believe there are about 12 schools that are in that pilot scheme."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "You said previously that it's a cause of concern for you that these schools that are failing or underachieving are not identified early enough. Are there signs that that's improving?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, one of the things that's very positive about this pilot scheme is that it's not just the schools that are officially causing concern that are a part of the pilot scheme, that is, the schools that we have identified, through inspections, as needing to be put in a statutory category. So, there are schools involved in the pilot scheme that the authorities and the consortia have identified themselves as schools that are at risk of causing concern. I believe that it's fair to say that we have not reached a point yet where we have a system of agreed criteria in relation to identifying these schools yet. I think that there has been initial work that has been commissioned or that is about to arrive in relation to that, and the types of measures you would expect us to take account of would be dissatisfaction from parents, staff leaving, a change in leadership. We use surveys with the children, for instance, and that gives you quite a good idea of whether a school is possibly facing difficulties. So, there's not one single criteria alone that will tell you, 'This is a school that is at risk of causing concern', but taken together, having a set of criteria that everyone has agreed would be a good way of monitoring schools, I believe."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. Well, we'll be coming on to that middle tier later on, and perhaps that's where the problem lies, namely that if there isn't an agreed system from consortia and yourselves, perhaps that's where the focus needs to be."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I would say that it's not the identification of the schools that is the greatest problem. The greatest problem is ensuring that there is support for them and that the support is multi-agency support, where all the agencies that support these schools are working together."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Well, how long does it take, therefore, for a school to move from an improvement category, in terms of special measures, to be escalated then? Because one sees sometimes that there's an excellent school, and within five years' time, it's in the red. So, there's a great deal of variance in that."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, that would be something quite unusual\u2014to move from excellent to red."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes, well, gradually, perhaps."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes. Perhaps Claire can respond to this."}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "On average, secondary schools that are in need of special measures take just over two years, on average. Some are shorter; some are quite a considerable amount longer. It's a little less for schools that go into significant improvement. With primary schools, of course, it's much shorter because the issues are far less complex; it's easier to bring about improvements in teaching. When you've got large numbers of staff, you've got large secondary schools, it takes time to actually bring about those improvements, but it is a long time, just over two years, when you think that some pupils, maybe in key stage 4 for the two years\u2014. Certainly, we want to see schools coming out of category much quicker, and this is where the multi-agency approach certainly is a positive step. All partners involved in supporting the school are involved in these improvement boards. They focus on bringing about improvement in the areas of the school that are weakest, and it is the responsibility of everybody involved\u2014that is: ourselves, the regions, local authorities, the schools themselves and their governing bodies\u2014to look at how they can best support the school to bring about that improvement. So, it's getting an agreement on what the issues are, and then planning the support so that we avoid duplication, but that we support the school in the areas they need more support. And we hope that this then will accelerate the improvement of the schools that find themselves in category. But, as Meilyr already said, there are some schools involved in that particular pilot that are at danger of causing serious concern. So, the pilot is trying out those two different approaches as well."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. And just finally from me, for the time being at least, the financial situation; we've spoken about that already this morning. If you could\u2014. If funding was injected into the system tomorrow, say, what would you spend it on? What aspects would benefit from that additional funding?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Were you asking about something specific there?"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "In the schools themselves, if you were a school leader, what would you\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Oh, if I were a school leader."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes. How would you use any additional funding that would flow into the school?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "It's difficult to make that decision, because every school is different. It is important, of course, that leaders do have the power and the ability to make those decisions themselves. But, certainly, in the short term, the type of thing I would have thought would be to prepare for the new curriculum. That means freeing up teachers to think about what the new curriculum means to them. The schools that have been a part of developing the curriculum have been in a fortunate position in that they've had plenty of time to think about this. So, it's now time\u2014and this was the chief message of my annual report this year\u2014for every school in Wales to start to think. Because I think that the new curriculum is truly an opportunity to take a forward step in terms of how we teach and learn within schools. But that means that time is needed for schools to think this through and, in that thinking, to contact the community, to talk to their children as well, to see what the community in its broader sense would like to see being in the new curriculum, because it's up to every school. Although the new curriculum sets a framework, it is up to each and every school to decide what they're going to teach, and what they're teaching in order to prepare their young people for this new world that we have in the twenty-first century. Therefore, to give you a somewhat superficial answer, I would be setting time aside for the training of teachers."}, {"speaker": "Jassa Scott", "content": "Can I just add one thing there? I think what we've seen over the years recently is that local authorities, to some extent, have safeguarded the funding that goes to the schools, but the effect of that is that we've seen less funding going into some of the local authority services; for example, those services that support well-being, that promote attendance, and that perhaps support behaviour and assistance for schools. So, I think that all of those factors contribute to how schools can support and assist their pupils, and to improve themselves. So, I think that side of things is important as well\u2014in the school or in the local authority, if funding is available, it should be allocated to all of those things so that those services can also support the children to succeed."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Just before we move on to the middle tier, if I can just ask about the quality of teaching? There's been a consistent message from Estyn that that is the weakest part of the system in Wales. The Government recognises that and has invested a very significant amount of money in that area, yet it's still an issue again in your annual report. You haven't said whether it's getting better or going in the right direction. What is your assessment of whether we are seeing the improvements we need to see in the quality of teaching?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think, in nearly all the elements of our framework, the picture is fairly similar. So, in terms of quality of teaching, we have seen gradual but quite small-scale improvements in primary. So, you can feel that that is going in the right direction. In secondary, it's more or less level; we haven't seen it getting particularly better or particularly worse. One of the things that's really important to realise is that the curriculum is about the quality of teaching. It is about the teaching and learning; those are two sides of the same coin, if you like. What's important is the learning experience that our pupils get in school. From the perspective of the pupil, it's the learning; from the perspective of the teacher, it's the teaching. They are two sides to the same coin. I think there's no doubt and I think there's general agreement that, in order to have a step change in the quality of teaching and learning\u2014. I think it was Einstein who said that if you keep on doing the same thing, you'll get the same result. So, you're going to have to change something, and what's changing is the curriculum. I think there's general consensus that this is the right approach to improve the quality of teaching. And that's exactly what all schools need to do now: to think how does this new curriculum affect them in their particular school, in their particular circumstances, in the context of their particular children. How can they use this opportunity now to improve the teaching and learning in their school?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "It does cause one concern, because if the teaching and learning standards just stay the same in the secondary sector, and we know that 12 per cent of secondary schools are under Estyn review and 11 per cent of them are in special measures, we're talking about half of the schools almost, and no improvement in the teaching quality in general. So, there is a major cohort of children captured in that situation, and then there's a new curriculum that comes in. I see the opportunities, but these schools that are doing well are going to go, 'Wow, up there', but schools are there in the bottom layer and one is genuinely concerned about those children in those schools. Isn't that where the focus should be and any additional funding that's allocated? You talked about releasing teachers for training, but perhaps it's in those particular schools that we need to focus."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I do agree that the best schools will welcome the opportunities and that their standards will improve even more. But then, with regard to the other schools, in a way, there are two very broad categories, which are those that need only a little support just to help them to improve\u2014. And I believe that the new curriculum and the general support that's going to be surrounding that will be the solution for those schools. It's going to be an opportunity for the quality of the teaching and the learning to improve. But you're right to say that there is another smaller cohort that has a much greater need for support, and they're going to find coping with the new curriculum difficult, because they'll also have many other problems. So, I do agree\u2014. And you're not talking about a huge number of schools\u2014some 200 secondary schools is what we have in Wales, so that percentage is relatively small, the number is relatively small\u2014but they need much greater support. That is why this pilot scheme of the multi-agency approach of supporting those schools is important. I do believe that you're right to say that there are funding implications to supporting those schools. I don't think it's enormous, but certainly there's a certain amount of funding that is needed to offer those schools that support."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Janet."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. The Minister recently told the committee that a number of recent Estyn inspections of local authorities' education services have been disappointing. Do you agree? That, of course, is based on the inspections carried out under the current cycle."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes, indeed. I think we've done nine inspections of local authorities' education services so far this cycle. We've got another two this academic year. We'll have done half of them by the end of the academic year. We'll then evaluate how things have gone. But of those nine we've put three into category\u2014we've identified them as causing concern\u2014and they're Pembrokeshire, Powys and Wrexham. So, we do have concerns about those authorities. So, we'll be supporting those authorities, moving forward. But I think a common factor in those inspections was secondary schools. So, we've talking quite a bit about secondary schools this morning, and I think that, again, is a factor in those local authorities."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. You say that the proportion of secondary schools causing concern is a challenge for several local authorities and for the system as a whole. Which local authorities are these\u2014you've probably named them all\u2014and have these been inspected yet under the current cycle?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think you're taking about three secondary schools in a category in Pembrokeshire, Wrexham and Torfaen. So, we've inspected Pembrokeshire and Wrexham already, but we haven't inspected Torfaen yet. And two schools in a category in Powys, Newport and Gwynedd. And we've inspected Powys and Newport, but we haven't inspected Gwynedd yet. So, in answer to your question: we've inspected most of those, but not all of them."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay. What is your latest assessment of how well the regional consortia are supporting and driving school improvement? Does this vary across the different regions?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "It certainly does vary, but I'll ask Jassa to go into more detail."}, {"speaker": "Jassa Scott", "content": "We haven't directly inspected the regional consortia since\u2014I think 2017 was the last time we did some direct monitoring with them. But I think, over the last three years, we do feel that they've improved their knowledge. They're still relatively new in the big scheme of things. So, they did take a little while to embed, and I think that came across when we did the work that we did with them back in 2017. But, more recently, they've improved their knowledge of individual schools' strengths and areas for improvement, and they are using this knowledge better to support and challenge schools, and particularly schools causing concern. But obviously, as we've been talking about this morning, there's still work to do. I think they've prioritised well the work that schools are doing around literacy and numeracy, but their support for schools to develop digital competence has been a bit weaker. Even though we've had the framework as an early part of the curriculum developments there, we haven't seen quite the focus that we've seen on other areas. I think for schools causing concern, what we found\u2014and we do look at their work through our local authority inspection, so we are getting some first-hand evidence of their impact through that\u2014they're not always focused, in those schools causing concern, on improving teaching and learning, so actually getting in and looking and working with teachers and with staff to actually make improvements there. I think, generally, their support for secondary schools has had less impact across the consortia than it has for primary schools, and I think sometimes that's because they're struggling to recruit appropriate specialists, to support with secondary, or perhaps they don't have the depth of strong practice that we talked about earlier within their region. So, they're having to work a bit harder to find effective practice, to share practice and to get the secondary expertise and knowledge to support those schools. We will be, over the next year, looking specifically at the work of consortia to support curriculum reform work. Well, we think we will be\u2014we haven\u2019t had our remit letter yet. But that's one of the areas we've discussed, about doing some specific work on over the next year to look in a bit more depth."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "So, what is the cycle of inspections for regional consortia, and how robust are those inspections? What areas do you cover?"}, {"speaker": "Jassa Scott", "content": "Well, regional consortia aren't actually statutory entities at the moment, and we don't have specific inspection powers relating to regional consortia. What we have are powers to inspect school improvement. So, on each of our local authority inspections, there will be, usually, an area that we're looking at that relates to school improvement, and that would involve us looking at the work of the consortia that the local authority has commissioned. What we've agreed with Welsh Government is that, over the next few years, we will take a thematic approach. So, the first area that we've said is that we'll look specifically at how each of them is supporting curriculum reform, and report on that. So, that will report specifically on the different ones, but it wouldn't be the same as doing an inspection of their work at this time."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Should they be on a statutory footing?"}, {"speaker": "Jassa Scott", "content": "Well, I think that's something to be discussed over the next few years. There's, obviously, local government legislation that has been debated recently, which has the potential to create corporate joint committees, and school improvement was one of the areas that is being considered there. So, there may be an opportunity, if that's created, to think how we then adapt inspection to look specifically at that. So, I think there is an opportunity. I think we do get a handle on their work through the local authority and, ultimately, it's looking at what that consortia brings to that local authority and to the schools and the pupils in that area that's the important bit, I think, ultimately, to see the impact there. So, we are looking at them in that way, and then taking that thematic approach, but we'll keep reviewing it over the next couple of years."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. And what are Estyn's views on the latest position regarding regional working in south-west and mid Wales? Would it be preferable for school improvement advisers to be based in the consortium, Education through Regional Work, rather than each local authority employing their own, as is the case at present?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "If I can just go back to the last question as well, what we did in order to inspect regions was we paused our local authority inspection cycle back in 2014, I think, for about three years. So, then, we spent time looking at regions, basically, because we didn't have the resource to do both at the same time. So, we're in negotiation with Welsh Government currently, so that, going forward, we can look at local authorities and regions at the same time. If regions become statutory entities, that would be in legislation, and then you could have legislation that gives us directly the powers to inspect them, which we don't currently have. So, we have to, effectively, wait for Welsh Government to ask us to do that work. But, as Jassa said, currently, what we intend to do in the short is to do some thematic work on that. In terms of ERW, they were the region that, at the end of the last cycle of regional inspections, we were still monitoring. We are concerned about their progress, particularly in the light of recent developments. So, for example, the chair of the joint committee has resigned, the managing director remains a temporary appointment and there are no clear plans for a permanent leadership. Some of the leadership team have left\u2014the capacity has gone down\u2014and various staff that were appointed last summer have already left. The budget has not been agreed and certain key meetings\u2014executive board and joint committee meetings\u2014have been cancelled. So, we are particularly worried about ERW, and, because of that, we will be going in to visit them in April\u2014next month\u2014and we'll be visiting all of the authorities to make sure that they do have a plan for an appropriate school improvement service going forward. But, Jassa, probably, can say a little bit more about our plans there."}, {"speaker": "Jassa Scott", "content": "Yes, I think you asked a specific question about, you know, which is better. I think our view has been that, generally, the local authorities are too small to deliver that whole range of school improvement services, particularly given the national reform agenda at the moment. We felt last summer, when we went to ERW, that they'd managed to reach the best possible model, given the constraint they've placed, collectively, on themselves\u2014that they want to deliver aspects of school improvement locally, through the local authorities, and have some central capacity. So, we felt that, given that they wanted to do some locally and some centrally, enough thought had been put into that structure last summer and that it could be workable. There were key aspects such as support for secondary schools causing concern and there was some capacity centrally that could support areas such as Powys.\u00a0Unfortunately, as Meilyr has described, some of those aspects have since been disbanded or those staff who were on secondment have gone back, so I think it is a key risk, particularly for some of those authorities you've talked about that are causing concern, such as Powys or Pembrokeshire\u2014that they haven't necessarily got that local capacity to support their schools causing concern. So, you've got some concerns within school capacity and you've got concerns about local authority capacity, and what you don't have there now is that collective capacity centrally that might support them. So, that's why we're going to go and do a slightly more detailed link visit to try to understand how they are mitigating the risks that we see are arising as a result of some of those things that have happened recently. Our understanding is that there's a joint committee meeting of ERW on 19 March, so, hopefully, after that point, we'll have a little bit more information about how they're planning to manage that collective set of services going forward\u2014it's a little bit of an unknown at the moment."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "You were asking, 'Would it be better for every authority to have their own team?' But, before regions were invented, if you like, we were saying consistently that they tended to be too small. What happened in practice was that authorities did come together voluntarily to have joint advisory services. So, you had Cynnal in the north west, you had the Education and School Improvement Service, you had Gwent\u2014so, they naturally did come together in groups, maybe a little bit smaller than the current regions, but they, of their own accord, produced something not very dissimilar to a region."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Si\u00e2n, did you have a supplementary?"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes, just on ERW. Does the fact that there is a dispute on the highest level feed down to the school and to the children? Are the children in south-west and mid Wales affected by this? Are standards decreasing in that part of Wales?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, it's difficult to say directly, but we have inspected nine authorities and two of those are in that area, so, the lack of support at that level, as Jassa was saying, may be the reason why those authorities are suffering difficulties."}, {"speaker": "Jassa Scott", "content": "And it is clear that many people across that area are expending energy and time discussing these issues. Any reorganisation does take energy out of the system, so it is clear that that time isn't then being spent, perhaps, on investment in improving schools and supporting staff in schools. So, as Meilyr says, it's not clear, but a lot of energy is being expended in that particular discussion that is ongoing."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Janet."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "What disadvantages could there be from Neath Port Talbot's intention to withdraw from regional working via ERW? And I've got to be honest, up in the north, I know that there are concerns about regional consortia, and when local authorities are under pressure financially, it questions, sometimes, the value of regional consortia. So, what disadvantages could there be from Neath Port Talbot's intention to withdraw from regional working via ERW?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think we've talked in general terms and we feel that local authorities probably are too small on their own. In general terms, you can't say that any particular authority couldn't, maybe, put things together in such a way that it's effective. Also, it has a knock-on effect on the rest of the consortium, if one withdraws. I don't know whether, Jassa, you've got anything to add to the general points we've made."}, {"speaker": "Jassa Scott", "content": "I mean, I think, what you've alluded to there, it has the potential to be a destabilising factor across the whole of the national model that we've got for supporting school improvement at a time where Welsh Government are kind of relying heavily on that consortium model to help support curriculum reform and to drive professional learning and be the conduit for lots of the aspects of reform that we've talked about. So, I think that potential risk of any destabilising across the system is a disadvantage generally. I think\u2014. Clearly, we've talked about that capacity at a local level. There is that aspect of what that means in terms of the joint capacity across the other authorities there. And I think it's just what I've already talked about in terms of being a distraction at a crucial time for support where schools need to feel that they're confident in where they need to go for support. I should say that we're planning, as part of that visit that we do in April, to survey schools in that region about the support that they're getting, be that from their authority or from the central teams in ERW. That's something we did at the time when we did the inspections previously, and we thought it would be helpful to get some first-hand views of any disadvantages or impact that they might be feeling, really."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. And then, finally, for me:what involvement has Estyn had with the strategic education delivery group chaired by Professor Dylan Jones and what are your expectations for how it will improve the work of the middle tier?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "We've been members of that group right from the beginning. I personally am on it and colleagues are on it as well, and I'm a member of the sub-group that does some of the background work for that group as well, and Estyn has given several presentations to that group. I think the group is important. I remember commenting the first time it met that it was welcoming. The rather obvious thing is that you get all the strategic educational organisations together in one room, but it had never been done before, as far as I know. So, it was a really important step forward for that to happen. I'm a very firm believer in making those relationships, building those relationships, so that people understand what each of us contributes to the whole of the education system. We need to have that forum to be able to make sure that we're clear about what each of our roles is."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay, thanks."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now from Dawn Bowden."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. Morning, all. In your report you talked about in early settings where skills development is less effective, that children begin to feel at a very early age that they can't do certain things. I don't know whether that is anecdotal evidence or is that specific outcome-based evidence\u2014whatever, it's quite worrying. But what do you think the long-term effect on a child's development has in that respect?"}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "It's probably worth saying that skill development is a strength in about three quarters of our schools\u2014primary schools and early years settings. But in a minority of schools and settings, as you've picked up, children are often introduced to things too early. So, they're introduced to phonics, they're introduced to learning to read, when they're not at that developmental stage. And really, long term, it means the children lose confidence, because if they're introduced to these things too early they don't succeed, they tend to need additional support, and it can give them a negative impression, it can give them negative thoughts about their ability. So, we need to address that, and really it's about\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Sorry, what sort of age range are we talking about here?"}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "These would be children from three to five."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay."}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "So, this is very, very early on."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "And is there something, then, in that\u2014and I don't think there's much we can do about that, but it may be in terms of the way that the schools or the early learning settings address this\u2014you will have children at a very young age that have almost a year's difference in their age group, so they're born just before 1 September or just after 1 September? So, that's a huge gap, isn't it, at that point in their development?"}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Is that not being addressed in a way that those children are being taught and approached at that age?"}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Right, okay. That's fine. In terms of reading and literacy skills, we still remain quite low in the Programme for International Student Assessment ratings for reading, and I know there is a particular concern about the impact on boys in that regard. What do you think are the most pressing priorities that face them around reading and literacy?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think literacy has been, and still is, and still needs to be a top priority. I mean, literacy clearly is something that underpins the rest of education, so it really does need to be a top priority. I think it has been a high priority, but we need to continue prioritising it. We've seen some improvements over the years. For example, we've given a lot of attention to writing over the years, and making sure that children get the opportunity to write in an extended way, not just short sentences, but having the opportunity to have extended writing, and there's some evidence that that now is beginning to have an effect. But almost ironically, the same sort of issue is true of reading. So, it's not just reading small little snippets\u2014we need to encourage children to have a love for reading and read whole books. So, I gave a little bit of attention to that in the annual report\u2014that that needs attention. I think the other thing I would emphasise is that this is not just for the foundation phase, it's not just for very young children\u2014it's really important at key stage 2 and in secondary school. One of the things we have been worried about, and I think there was some reflection of this in PISA, is that there are strengths in reading in Wales. So, PISA, for example, said that children in Wales are very good at comparing lots of little snippets, but what they're saying, and they're saying this themselves, is that the love of books is decreasing, and the number of children who read regularly whole books. So, I think there is something there for teachers to set and model a good example, to show their own interest in reading, to encourage children to read themselves."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "It's probably a wider societal problem as well, isn't it? I'm thinking about gaming, electronic gaming, computers."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Absolutely. I think there is some sort of link with the digital world, and the way people read\u2014the actual technique of reading, is evolving. But I think reading is so important, and developing a complex vocabulary is so important in being able to communicate, in order to get a good job, to have enjoyment out of life\u2014all of those things are so important. We ourselves are going to give this quite a lot of priority in future, so we're doing a major piece of work on language acquisition, which will cover some of this next year. Every year one of our thematics is the major bit of work we do, and we try to support that with a conference. So,\u00a0that will be the focus that we give to our work next year\u2014it is on language acquisition."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay, thank you for that. Just one other supplementary on that, I guess, is whether you have a good idea of how many young people are coming out of school at 16\u2014so, those that are not staying on to do A-levels\u2014and are coming out with an inability to read or white. Do we know what the figure is for that?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I can't tell you that off the top of my head, but I'm sure that there will be evidence. That's not something we inspect as such."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "No, no, but there should be evidence around that. Okay."}, {"speaker": "Jassa Scott", "content": "There has been a shift in that there's been continued emphasis in post-16 education and training around literacy and picking that up. For example, anyone who's studying in a further education college will have to do resits. There's an aim to try and get everyone to a basic level. In apprenticeships they'll use essential skills and so on to try and get that basic level of literacy as well, so there is an emphasis. I think one of the worrying indications, maybe, that post-16 sectors find is that sometimes even when learners are coming out with a basic qualification in a GCSE, potentially in English or a literature subject, they don't necessarily have a really good foundation of some of the basic skills as well. So, there is a lot of work to do in this area."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay, all right. Could I just move you on\u2014? Sorry\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "The only thing I would add to that is, I guess, it's quite small, the number of people who don't have basic reading. I think one of the things we need to emphasise is that learning reading is something you do throughout your life, and what we need to do is to develop, in particular, pupils' higher level reading skills. The fact that they can just read isn't the end of the story; they need to be developing those higher level reading skills and continuing to widen the range of things they read, and be able to develop their vocabulary at a higher level."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "And their comprehension, I guess."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Sorry?"}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "And their comprehension as well."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Absolutely, yes\u2014those higher level skills of comprehension and inference and those sorts of things."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Sure, okay. Can I just move you on, then, to numeracy and whether you can tell us if you're satisfied with the progress in numeracy, because I think we were doing better on the PISA results in maths in Wales than we did previously? So, what are your thoughts on that?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think there is a fairly clear good news story here. PISA shows improvements and a lot of that can be attributed, I think, to the new GCSE mathematics numeracy. I think there's much less predictability in that work; you can't approach it in a formulaic way, either the pupils or the teachers in terms of teaching it. There's much more problem solving. It's about applying what you've learnt in the core mathematics lessons to new situations in subjects across the curriculum. I think that that GCSE numeracy has built on the work that's been done lower down on the national numeracy framework, which has the same philosophy of applying that mathematics knowledge in a problem-solving situation. That has been a really good news story, really."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "That's something to be positive about, anyway. That's good. My final question, Chair, is: in your view, to what extent is Wales on track to meet the target of 500 points in each of the domains in the 2020-1 cycle for PISA?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think that that target is somewhat arbitrary, but assuming that we continue on this journey that we are on\u2014the current change programme of the new curriculum and so forth\u2014I think we would expect to see those improvements we've seen in science and in mathematics to continue. We've talked about reading and I think we will be giving more attention to reading. I think the education system more generally, hopefully, will give more attention to reading. So, I would hope to see improvements there as well. The only other thing I would add is that there is some research that indicates or suggests that the effect of schools is greater on mathematics and science than on reading, and the reason for that is you don't do a lot mathematics or science in the home. But the attitude towards reading is very much dependent on family and community factors, more so, maybe, than mathematics and science. So, I think that's another reason why I think a community-school approach is really important. You need to get everybody on board; it's not just what the teacher does in the classroom\u2014it's important that the whole family and the community thinks that reading is important."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Just on numeracy, it was interesting because one of the schools in my constituency have actually contacted my office and a number of other organisations across the constituency to ask us how we use maths in our work. So, they're obviously trying to relate that now to everyday life and working, which I thought was quite good."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "That's good."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "We've got some questions now around progress of specific groups of pupils. If I can start and ask you how concerning is it that the gap between pupils eligible for free school meals and other pupils has not narrowed in the last 10 years, especially given the \u00a3475 million pupil deprivation grant investment."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes. I think secondary schools and the issue of poverty were the two things I've noted in the annual report. So, I think it is a concern to us. I think it is worth also remembering that compared to other countries, for example, in PISA, we do compare quite well in terms of equity. There's also an argument that maybe poverty and austerity have increased, so that we're in a way running to keep still. And I think also, as I was suggesting about the reading, poverty really is a social phenomenon. Schools can't solve that on their own. So, there are a lot of caveats to be made around the fact that that poverty gap hasn't closed, but that's not to say that schools can't do something about it, and I've suggested in the annual report a sort of a two-pronged approach. One is the new curriculum. I think there is evidence in the international research that teaching and learning, better teaching and learning, helps disadvantaged poor pupils disproportionately. So, they gain more from it that their peers. So, I think improving teaching and learning, and we discussed that earlier this morning about how the new curriculum is really all about improving the quality of teaching and learning in the classroom. So, that's one approach, and then the other approach, which I've also mentioned earlier, is having a community-focused approach to schools. The schools that do more successfully tackle the poverty gap are the schools that take that kind of approach. It means helping the pupils. It means helping their families. It's about making pupil well-being really high on the agenda. It's very difficult for children to do well in school if they've got all kinds of things happening in their background. So, it's important that schools can maybe signpost those families to other services that can support them and help them. So, it's quite a complex\u2014. It's challenging for schools to go down this route, and I think the more help we can give schools to take that approach, the better. But the schools that do do it do benefit a lot from it. They have better engagement from parents, from the families, and that then reflects back on the work of the children."}, {"speaker": "Jassa Scott", "content": "And we've just published a collection of good practice about how schools support vulnerable learners, and we'll be teasing out the aspects around community-focused schools a lot more in a report that we'll publish in the next couple of months. So, we've kind of drilled down and looked at what some schools are doing in that area in a bit more detail."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Suzy, on this."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, just quickly. Obviously, I think we've all been to schools where the PDG is actually used to engage parents more for exactly the reasons you say. But I just wanted to interrogate the deprivation gap a little bit, because, of course, even though, as you say, there's perhaps more equity in Wales, one of the reasons for that is because our children from better-off backgrounds do less well, and considerably less well than their peers in the other parts of the United Kingdom. So, whereas their attainment gaps are pretty dreadful, that's one of the reasons\u2014that our better-off children aren't doing as well as perhaps they might do. Is that a concern as well? We don't want this rush to the middle, do we?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think it's essential that all groups of pupils do as well as they possibly can, absolutely. So, it's not quite the same issue, but we've talked about the importance of making sure that more able and talented children do well."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "They're not the same."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "They're not the same, clearly, because you have more able and talented children from poor backgrounds. Differentiation is a challenge for schools,\u00a0but it's absolutely essential that all groups of children do as well as they possibly can. So, in things like PISA, in terms of reading, for example, we can't just say it's that group that needs to improve\u2014all the groups need to improve. And I think that's why something like the new curriculum gives schools more scope to tailor their teaching and learning to the particular groups that they have, whether they\u2019re more able, whether they're advantaged or whether they're disadvantaged."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, thanks. Thank you, Lynne."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Pupils' confidence in their school's ability to help them with their emotional and mental well-being is much less at secondary school and that's been a consistent theme as well from your reports. Why do you think that is?"}, {"speaker": "Jassa Scott", "content": "Yes, you're right. As we mentioned earlier, we do pupil surveys before all our inspections, and across a number of those indicators, like, 'How well does the school listen? Do adults in school care about me? How well does the school deal with bullying?'\u2014quite a lot those ones around well-being do tail off. Nine out of 10 pupils at key stage 2 have that confidence, down to half at key stage 4, as you say. And I think there are a number of factors that we think contribute to that: I think one of the factors is that pupils face, sometimes, more challenges as they get older in those teenage years, but they also become more reflective and perhaps more discerning. And I think what we find in secondary schools is perhaps secondary school pupils notice sometimes the differences between their everyday life that they experience in school and perhaps the messages that they're getting about well-being in terms of their lessons, in terms of assemblies and in terms of school policies and so on. So, they are probably more discerning in noticing those differences and maybe there are some of those differences also there in primary school, but the pupils don't notice. I think we've already touched upon things like the differences in the way that, at primary school, you would tend to have a go-to adult, which is your teacher. The best secondary schools find ways to make sure that pupils do feel that level of support and feel there are trusted people, but it's more of a challenge to make sure that that happens, because of the way they're operating. We still have some concerns about personal and social education and the health and well-being support, which we've made a recommendation about in the past in some of our thematic reports, but also recently in some of our secondary school inspection reports. And I think I already touched upon the fact that sometimes, when the budget is tight, it can be some of those\u2014they're not peripheral in their importance, but they're not the teacher in the classroom: well-being support assistants and so on and family liaison workers\u2014staff in the school who perhaps really support that pastoral care that the school as a whole can provide\u2014it may be that those are the roles that are less prevalent at times of less funding. So, I think there are some great members of staff doing a really good job, but perhaps they're not those members of staff who can support teachers and support pupils in creating that kind of caring environment. Maybe there a fewer of them around. So, I think there's not an obvious answer and part of it is that they do become more discerning and perhaps more vocal in those responses generally, as they get older. So, you might have a truer reflection of opinions than perhaps\u2014. And that might explain some of the difference with primary, where, generally, they're quite positive about everything across most of the schools that we ask."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "So, it's not that secondary schools\u2014because you've said that in a previous inspection report\u2014are just not as good at prioritising mental health and well-being."}, {"speaker": "Jassa Scott", "content": "I think there's an element that it's more of a challenge for a secondary school to provide an effective set of support from that whole-staff awareness of some of the challenges. And one of the pieces of work we've done recently is around adverse childhood experiences, and we have found that primary schools have taken that and embraced it. Once you've trained your staff, then they've got that knowledge. They're the ones who are working day to day with the schools. Secondary schools haven't always taken a whole-school approach to that. They might have trained a set of staff. So, maybe not every member of staff has the same level of understanding, but also those staff aren't spending the same amount of time with pupils. So, in terms of getting to know pupils, picking up on signs that they may be struggling, or that there might be concerns\u2014it's much more of a challenge. You've got to work a lot harder as a secondary school to make sure that staff have that knowledge and that you've got the tracking systems that can put those different bits of\u00a0 information together to actually mean that you can target support where it's needed."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Suzy."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I'm just thinking again about specific groups of pupils. Obviously, we've had one case in north Wales, in an independent school, where there were serious concerns. What's that done to your desire to monitor and check what's going on in these independent schools? Are they regulated sufficiently?"}, {"speaker": "Jassa Scott", "content": "I'll pick up on that as well. Just to explain how we work with independent schools, initially, to give the context. So, there are different kinds of independent schools. So, some have boarding provision, and where they have boarding provision, Care Inspectorate Wales would look at the boarding side of it, we'd look at the educational side of it. There are others where they may have a linked children's home, which can be another room in the same house, or it can be a number of miles away, and similarly there CIW would look at the residential aspects of the care and we'd look at the school. So, I think, there's a focus in the independent school standards regulations, which is a minimum that all schools have to meet to maintain a registration. There is a focus in that on how that school looks after and cares for its pupils, and there are focuses on that element of boarding provision where relevant, and the national minimum standards that the care inspectorate look at that have aspects around supporting well-being as well. What we do find in our inspections is that, overall, we generally find that pupils' well-being develops, they make good progress, and that care, support and guidance that schools give is good. What we mean by that, really, practically, is that they are developing their resilience and their self-esteem. In special schools, this might mean particularly that those pupils learn to manage their anxieties better so that they improve their behaviour, which may be one of the reasons why they're in that specialist setting. In mainstream independent schools, what we find is that people develop their tenacity, their curiosity for learning\u2014their resilience in that way. But there are shortcomings sometimes. For example, there was one school where we found that they weren't making appropriate referrals to child and adolescent mental health services. So, these schools do operate independently by their nature, and their awareness, perhaps, of some of the guidance and support that is out there\u2014sometimes, maybe, there can be more to be done, and I think we've talked to Welsh Government about that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "What's Estyn's role in that\u2014to bring that level of awareness to those schools?"}, {"speaker": "Jassa Scott", "content": "I think we do through our inspection guidance, and the independent school standards do refer to Welsh Government guidance\u2014it's something like 'Keeping learners safe', which is a really key document, which supports safeguarding and caring across schools. That's regularly discussed and talked about and referred to with those schools. So, I think the other area is that sometimes we don't have the intelligence about what\u2014. So, for example, if there's been a safeguarding referral from a school, we don't necessarily always get that information, which means that when we do go to inspect, we may not have the full picture to help us tailor our inspection activity. So, that's something we've raised\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "[Inaudible.]\u2014be brief and brief in answers."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Al right, okay. Do you mind if I move on to the next question?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "We're going to have to skip those, I'm afraid, and talk to the last set of questions, just because of the time pressures. Hefin."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I'd like to ask in Welsh, please. What role, if any, did Estyn have in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's latest review of progress in school improvement when they visited Wales in late 2019?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, we were interviewed. Therefore, the three of us had an interview with the OECD officials and we offered evidence to them. And I think that, when the report is published, you will see that the OECD does draw on our broader evidence and will be quoting our reports\u2014the annual report and some of our thematic reports. That is the part that we played in that work."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Thanks. How significant a role do you believe the national evaluation and improvement resource will play in raising school standards?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think that it's very important. It's Claire who has been specifically tasked with that, so I'll ask Claire to speak about it."}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "I think working together with the practitioners, the regions and representatives from local authorities is a great opportunity to develop a national approach, because we know across Wales there's some excellent practice, but we know there are schools that struggle to bring about improvement. So, this national resource has the potential to provide schools with detailed guidance on how they can approach not only self-evaluation, but, more importantly, how they can bring about that improvement. So, it will be a resource that develops over time. It's starting\u2014we're piloting currently with around 40 schools. Half of those have been involved in developing the tools and approaches right from the start, and 22 new schools have come on board this year. But we anticipate that there will be lots of tools and approaches within that resource that schools can use to improve the quality of self-evaluation throughout the school, primaries, secondaries, PRUs and special schools. But it will focus on establishing a culture within the school that focuses on improvement, that establishes a reflective culture where all staff are involved in development. So, we're hoping that this tool\u2014it's still currently in development, but we hope that that will support schools really well."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, it's an evolving piece of work."}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "Yes, it is."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. And, with regard to comparison of performance, does the lack of comparative attainment data raise difficulties when you're inspecting and drawing conclusions and standards in schools?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Not really, no. I think there was a bit of a myth that a lot of this performance data was just for Estyn, but actually it never has been. When we inspect, we look at a whole range of aspects of the work. We look at standards, we look at teaching and learning in the classroom, we look at well-being, we look at care support and guidance, we look at leadership, we look at all of these things, and we look at it based on first-hand evidence\u2014what we actually see in the classroom. So, we're quite happy to continue to inspect schools, and we in fact support having less emphasis on data because, although data is useful, and we hope that schools will continue to analyse their data and use that data to help them self-improve and self-evaluate, we don't actually need it and it has actually created a bit of a high-stakes culture. So, I think stepping back from that culture is a good idea."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you very much.

We've received no apologies for absence. Can I ask Members who are present if they wish to declare any interests? Okay, thank you. Item 2 this morning is our final evidence session for our inquiry into targeted funding to improve educational outcomes. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Cabinet Secretary for Education; Steve Davies, director of the education directorate; and Ruth Conway, deputy director, support for learners division. Welcome to all of you, and thank you for your attendance and also for the paper that you've provided in advance. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions, and the first questions are from Llyr Gruffydd."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Bore da. I just want to start by asking some questions around the targeting of the pupil development grant because, clearly, we've had a lot of evidence around this apparent blurring of eligibility to an extent. I'm just wondering how comfortable you are that the money is being targeted appropriately because, clearly, it's being targeted more widely than just those eligible for free school meals, from some of the evidence we've had, but also that it seems to be predominantly focused on low-attaining frees\u2014pupils who are eligible for free school meals."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Thank you, Llyr. I think it's important to be absolutely clear that when it comes to individual interventions, those individual interventions should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals. But in some cases, schools may use their PDG funding to provide a universal intervention, but we would want to\u2014in challenge advisers' discussions in schools\u2014we'd want to have evidence that that universal intervention would have a disproportionate effect on the outcomes for children on free school meals. So, for instance, if I give you an example in your own region, Llyr: at Brynteg County Primary School in Wrexham, if you look at that primary school in Wrexham, their results for free-school-meal children at the end of their primary school period in school are equivalent to their non-free-school-meal counterparts. So, there is no differentiation in those results. One of the things that they've used their PDG for is to really focus on the concept of growth mindset in school. So, that's a universal thing that they've trained all the teachers in, but what we know is that that has a disproportionate effect on those children who are on free school meals. So, if you're familiar with the concept of a growth mindset, it's about really challenging learners to think that, 'I can do things. If sometimes I fail, I pick myself up, I'm more resilient.' Now, that has been, as I said, trained to all the teachers in the school\u2014it's an ethos for the whole school\u2014but we have seen that the impact on the free-school-meal children has been even greater, and now they're at the same level. So, that's the important distinction. Individual intervention per child has to be targeted at those children who are eligible\u00a0for free school meals, but sometimes a school will employ a whole-school approach to train their staff, for instance, and that, then, has to demonstrate it has a disproportionate effect on free school meals. So, growth mindset; it may be attachment disorder training for staff, for instance, where we know it's of benefit to everybody, but will have particular benefits for that cohort of students. With regard to more able and talented, you know, Llyr, that this is an area of concern for me, generally, within the Welsh education system; that we've not been particularly good at identifying, supporting and driving attainment for those children. I'm absolutely clear that PDG needs to be used for those children who are eligible to drive potential, whatever the potential of that child is, including more able and talented. And again, I'll give you an example that has been seen as good practice in Pembrokeshire: a window on the world bus, again paid for by schools. I don't know if you're aware of it."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "We've heard about that."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Oh, you've heard about it; well, it's a really good example the window on the world. And, again, that's very much targeted at raising aspirations and giving children who are more able and talented, who are eligible for PDG, those experiences,\u00a0and to really push them. So, yes, I'm absolutely clear that PDG shouldn't just be seen to be getting individuals to the average. For those children who are more able and talented, it should be used to support them\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "And we all share those aspirations, I'm sure, and you pointed to examples of good practice, but of course, it's not universal, is it, so what I'm asking is: do you think that the guidance is sufficient as it is? Do you think that there's a great enough awareness of how the PDG should be used at the coalface? And also, are you confident that consortia and others have the measures in place to be able to demonstrate that\u00a0it is being used properly?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think, if we look at what Estyn has said about PDG, it does actually recognise that the PDG is being used to push more able and talented children, but as always with the system, Llyr, it's whether we can be sure that that is strategic and that it's happening across all of our schools. So, you're\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "But not just in relation to more able and talented, I'm referring to the eligibility and the targeting."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Oh, the eligibility. You'll be aware that, on the advice of Sir Alasdair, we have employed and appointed new PDG regional advisers, and I think their role is going to be absolutely crucial in spreading that good practice across the region, whether that's use of PDG for more able and talented, or ensuring that PDG is used in the appropriate way. So, that's there to provide strategic overall advice. And obviously, we have been very clear with regional challenge advisers, in the relationship and the conversations they're having with individual schools, that they're really challenging their schools about the use of PDG, not just in terms of targeting, but the programmes, what the money is being spent on, whether there is an evidence base for that and whether we are clear on impact. So, I think the new regional advisers are going to be crucial in enabling us to ensure more consistent practice across the regions."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So, are you content that eligibility for free school meals is the best measure, really, of identifying which pupils to target?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Llyr, in the absence of anything better. I'll be the first person to say that maybe it's not as absolutely focused, but in the absence of anything different to identify a proxy for need, I think it's probably the best that\u00a0we've got at present. And we will continue to have discussions with local government about whether there\u00a0are different ways. We have to be mindful. Some of the policy levers in this area are out of my hands, so if we look at the roll-out of universal credit, for instance, we've got officials working very hard at the moment to try and understand what universal credit is going to mean and where we are going to be able to identify relative need, going forward. We haven't had any additional resource as a result of this, but we're very mindful that, potentially, this has an impact, going forward. And, officials are working all of the time, I must say, in conjunction with the department in England, to understand their thinking in this area so that we are in a position to make some decisions about what a notional eligibility for free school meals will look like going forward, but before I make any decisions, I want to assure everybody that\u00a0there will be a full public consultation on that."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Okay. Finally for now, on this issue of once a year, in January, if you're eligible for free school meals, then you're in that\u00a0group for that year. We've had some quite strong evidence about how difficult that makes longer term planning for a number of schools and we've also been pointed in the direction of what's happened in England with the Ever 6, and I'm just wondering\u00a0whether you're giving any thought to maybe changing that a little bit."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, we're certainly giving thought to flexibility. In conversations with Alasdair, who is our independent adviser on this agenda, and individual schools, we're actively giving thought to greater flexibility and maybe longer term projections, so that schools know, for a number of years ahead, what their allocation will be. There are advantages to that system, because you could give that flexibility, you could give that long-term approach, but then, how do you make that responsive if a school suddenly has more children? We do know that, actually, the number of free-school-meal pupils is dropping. But there can be changes, you know, regional working in areas of north Wales in tourism, or maybe in other areas at Christmas time, parents are able to get a period of work.\u00a0So, how can we create a more flexible system? We're actively looking at that at the moment. I wouldn't use it as an Ever 6\u00a0concept, but as an 'Ever 2' concept. We have looked at Ever 6,\u00a0and I'm going to be absolutely blunt with you: to introduce an Ever 6\u00a0concept for Wales would mean in the region of identifying an additional \u00a340 million. I'm going to be absolutely straight and blunt with you: we're not in a position at the moment to be able to identify an additional \u00a340 million to introduce an Ever 6. But issues around flexibility, certainly, are actively under consideration. In fact, we'll be having a discussion later on today about decisions, going forward, for the next two years."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Darren on this."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "It's just a very brief point in response to the \u00a340 million price ticket that you just put on that. That's, of course, assuming that you maintain the current level of PDG,\u00a0yes? So, if you reduced the level of PDG slightly, but made it available to more individuals, if you like, via allocating it in a different way, then that \u00a340 million price ticket wouldn't be there, would it?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I was asked a question about had I ever\u00a0considered an Ever 6. We have looked at that, we've priced that up. I have to make decisions in the envelope of resources that are available to me. We could, indeed, change the way in which we allocate PDG money, but we have to do it within the envelope that is available to me, over \u00a390 million. That's a significant level of investment, but, of course, as always, Darren, we could cut the amount per pupil, but that might have quite challenging swings in allocations. What we have done\u2014because what I am clear on is that there was evidence to suggest that in the secondary sector, a great deal of PDG was being focused on years 10 and 11, especially year 11, in catch-up provision, and you'll be aware, because we've said this in evidence to the committee in the papers, we've set a challenge to secondary schools to say, 'Actually, the majority of your PDG allocation has to be used in key stage 3.'\u00a0Now, we have to balance the needs, the moral hazard of turning round to children in years 10 and 11 and saying, 'We're\u00a0not going to provide catch-up opportunities for you,'\u00a0because, clearly, those children need that support. But the evidence and the advice that we're receiving is: actually, strong focus on early years, primary and key stage 3, if we get that right, should negate the need for spending money on catch-up at years 10 and 11. That's why we, in our advice to local authorities and schools, say that we want to see evidence that they're spending this money earlier on in a child's career, rather than just a scramble at year 11 to say, 'Right, we've got to get you through your exams.'"}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Okay, but have you actively considered, then, reducing the level you have?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We've\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Ruth Conway", "content": "Sorry\u2014I was just going to say that one of the things is looking at the scope of the definition,\u00a0and I think it's about being more flexible with the definition, rather than reducing the amount per head."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. If we can go on, then, to talk about some of the practical uses of the PDG, you write in your written paper that 'the majority of schools are making\u00a0well thought out and appropriate decisions' on how to use it. But Estyn reported that only two thirds\u00a0of primary and secondary schools make effective use of the PDG. Given that we've had it now for six years, would you not have expected there to be a higher level of schools actually making good use of that funding?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, to flip it on its head, the vast majority of schools, as identified by Estyn, are using this money to good effect. So, that's the way I like to see it\u2014that the vast majority of schools are doing well. What Estyn\u00a0has also indicated is the intrinsic link here to leadership within individual schools, and as you'll be aware, leadership, improving capacity in leadership and developing leadership talent in the Welsh education system is a key priority for me in our national mission. Of course, that's being developed in a different work stream. I think what's fair to say is that the use of PDG is evolving over time. I think we are seeing, increasingly, more and more schools understanding how best to deploy that money for best effect for students. So, if we're honest, when PDG first started, I think, in some schools\u00a0it was spent on investing in tracking of children, because they'd never thought about tracking these children, they didn't have systems in place to look at the performance of these children, and to have a system in place. So we've moved now from spending money on the infrastructure around support for FSM children into actual inputs in terms of teaching and learning. We're also seeing from Estyn that, actually, in terms of money following the evidence of what we know works, Estyn says that PDG is probably the best example of schools following tried and tested and evidence-based interventions to deploy the money. But clearly we want all of this money to be deployed as well as it can be, and again we come back to the decision I've made to appoint regional PDG advisers so that we can get that better consistency of approach. We are, in the discussions that I have with the regional consortia about how they challenge individual schools on usage, looking for very clear evidence of schools using the Sutton Trust toolkit, and we could have a discussion about whether that's the right thing, because that's on my mind too. But we want to see schools demonstrating their evidence base, and if they're not, if a school isn't doing that, okay, so demonstrate to us why you've made those decisions and, crucially, what are you doing as the school to judge whether that decision is actually making a difference for your individual pupils. So, if you're moving away from tried and tested interventions, what we know works, if you're doing something different with your money, okay, you need to justify that and you need to explain how you're going to demonstrate impact. But I think what we're seeing is increasing good practice in this area as the PDG develops and as our understanding of our school-to-school working in our self-improving school system also develops. I think we're seeing better usage of the money year on year."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Llyr on this."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "You mentioned some schools will be moving from the tried-and-tested interventions, really, and I'm just wondering to what extent that evolution of use of PDG is being driven by cuts to core funding."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No, I don't think it's being driven by cuts to core funding. I think there has been\u2014. One of the biggest impacts of PDG has not been\u2014well, I suppose it is\u00a0the money in itself, because the money has concentrated the minds, hasn't it? So, one of the most important things that PDG has done is highlight the importance of this agenda within schools, and really raise this up in the thinking of leadership and senior management teams in our schools, and has driven a focus on scrutiny and accountability in the systems that are working with our schools. I think the changing use of PDG reflects the journeys that schools have been on, some of them from a very low base where this was not a priority for them, to better understanding, and as research and as intelligence grows over time in this area, both in Wales and outside of Wales, schools are increasingly learning to use that evidence to tailor approaches in their schools."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So you wouldn't accept at all that some of this money's being used to paper over some funding cracks from elsewhere. Because the unions and some others have told us that, whether we like it or not, there is some of that going on."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "As I said, Llyr, we're very clear about the usage that this money can be spent on in terms of individuals or universal application within schools, and that forms an important part of the checks and balances that we have in our system. Can we continue to improve, and ensure that more and more of our schools are employing best practice? Yes, we can, and as I've said, we've taken steps to put in place the infrastructure to support that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Mark's questions are next."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Cabinet Secretary, how would you assess the impact of PDG on attendance and hopefully subsequent engagement with education from children who have free school meals?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think what's important to note is that, as Estyn have themselves said, over the period of the last inspection report, we have seen improvements in attendance,\u00a0but I do think we need to, again, look at how PDG can support this particular agenda. And as always in the Welsh education system, there are some excellent examples of how schools use the money to address this. Ysgol y Preseli in Pembrokeshire is a very good example of how they've deployed their money. Forgive me; I can't off the top of my head remember the name of the primary school I visited, again in north Wales, where the school has proactively used this money, and they actually send teaching assistants out of school in the morning before the start of the school day, and they actually have a walking bus. They call at homes for children, and they walk the children to the breakfast club. So, they're proactively going out into the community and making sure that those children are in the classrooms, because the teacher said, 'We recognised we had a problem with attendance. We tried a variety of means of improving that, but in the end we have taken this quite bold step\u2014we actually send the staff out and they create that walking bus, and they walk the children into school'. They say that they know that, for some of those children, because of the difficult circumstances they and their families are living in, they probably wouldn't be in school if it wasn't for that proactive approach. So, we're looking again at what more we can do to support this particular agenda in terms of improving attendance, because although, again, there are examples of good practice, there is still a gap between the attendance of free-school-meal pupils and non-free-school-meal pupils. And, of course, we can have the best curriculum in the world with really high-quality teaching, but unless the children are in the classes then we're not going to make the difference for them. Whilst that differential exists, then it's going to be hard to close the attainment gap for those children."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "I was actually quite shocked just reading in advance of this meeting that the proportion attending 95 per cent or more, who have pretty full attendance, was only 35 per cent for free-school-meal children at level 4, compared to 60 per cent for non-free-school-meal pupils. It still is an extraordinary difference. My colleague here showed me, I think, last week, a graph showing the link between attendance and attainment, in particular. When people were absent, a lot of the\u2014. As I'm sure you're aware, there's a huge connection. What more can PDG do to deal with it? In the example you give I can see how a school with an awful lot of free-school-meal children could do that, but a lot of the free-school-meal children are actually in schools that don't have that high a proportion of free school meals, where it would be much more challenging to bring in that type of initiative."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, indeed, and I think it gets more challenging the older the children get. I think it's more difficult to find interventions that are successful higher up, so key stage 4. So, you can do a walking bus with little ones, can't you, but I don't suppose your average 15 or 16-year-old is going to take very kindly to that. So, you do need a different approach to that. But again, we see in Ysgol y Preseli the employment of staff to directly work with families of older children to reinforce the messages around, as you quite rightly say, the linkage between attendance and attainment, and really work with individual families to understand the barriers to attendance: what's going on in the family that is preventing that child from going to school, and what more can the school do to address those situations. But you're absolutely right; there is more that we need to do to address this particular agenda of attainment. I don't know if there's anything extra you wanted to add, Steve."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "There is also another very good example\u2014and I take what you say about where there are small numbers\u2014but in our secondary schools where there are significant numbers, they're investing PDG in resources like a school nurse and a school counsellor, not just to work with the children but link to other agencies on whom the children and the families are dependent to support them in terms of working with schools. So, it's something, particularly in our most challenging areas, where it cannot just be delivered within the school. So, good use of that resource is being made to employ people to support them in those wider areas."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Thank you. To what extent is PDG also used to seek to reduce the higher rates of exclusion for children entitled to free school meals?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "So, if we looked at permanent exclusions, there isn't a differential, but if we look at temporary exclusions, there we see there is a disproportionate number of children on free school meals that are subject to those exclusions. Again, I think\u00a0what schools employing best practice understand is that you need a multi-agency approach to supporting that particular child. Some of those exclusions can be as a result of the need to address other issues going on in a child's life. So, this is where we come back to the committee's work, for instance, on mental health and support for children, support for behaviour in school. So, again, it's a multi-agency approach that I think we need, and, in our good schools, our really, really good schools, there's a recognition of that need to have a whole team around a child to support that child in education. With EOTAS,\u00a0we made some changes last year regarding PDG for EOTAS. So, for those children who do find themselves in education other than at school, we are providing additional support that previously was not available."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. We're going to move on now to talk about the impact of PDG on attainment. Hefin David has got some questions."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "It appears that the attainment gap at 2017 has actually widened, in spite of PDG levels. Is that correct?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes. So, if you look at it\u2014with the usual caveats about whether you can make direct comparisons on level 2 plus between the exams the year before and the exams that we had last summer\u2014on the face of it, the gap has increased. I think what's important to recognise, Hefin, is a direction of travel. I'm sure we all want to, because I want to, have a discussion about why children on free school meals were less resilient in the exam system last year. But, if we look at the period that we have been employing PDG, over that period, we have seen a narrowing of the gap. I think what's quite stark,\u00a0if we think about it\u2014. So, if we look at where we started from: in 2009, one in five children on free school meals got level 2 plus\u2014one in five\u2014by 2016, we had got that down to one in three. Obviously, there's still a way to go, but, Sir Alasdair, who knows about these things, says that that is a significant improvement.\u00a0Last year, we got some challenges. We need to understand why that happened, but I do think it's\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Why, do you think?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Why, do I think?\u00a0What I do think is there is no one answer. There is no one answer to this. I think we could look at and we can have discussions around the move from BTEC to science GCSEs. I think we have supplied figures to the committee about the significant change in the number of children on free school meals who weren't doing a single science GCSE and are now doing science GCSEs. We can look at the unintended consequences of literature. Again, we've supplied figures. Where children have done language and literature, whether that be through the medium of English or through the medium of Welsh, there is more resilience. So, it's that exposure to literacy\u00a0in all its forms that I think\u00a0could potentially make a difference. So, I think there's no one answer to why free-school-meal children were not so resilient last year. We continue to have discussions with Qualifications Wales to get a better understanding of this. At my next ministerial policy board, in May, we'll be doing a deep dive into this particular subject."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, to what extent would exam\u00a0boards be responsible for lack of grade stability?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "It could be one of the contributory factors. What I think is important is that there is no one, single reason why there seems to be less resilience in this cohort of children."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Will you be speaking to the exam boards about this and raising concerns?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I have written to Qualifications Wales, we've had discussions about it, but I've asked them to formally submit evidence ahead of my policy board for May, where, as I said, we will be doing a formal, deep-dive discussion across the department about these issues. But, again,\u00a0Hefin,\u00a0what we've got to be clear on is\u2014while we look at overall factors, you know, our overall national statistic\u2014we did see some schools last year whose FSM performance was better than it had been the year before. So, what was it in those schools that enabled those children to do really well, whereas, in other schools, the performance was different? Even in individual cities, you can see a huge variety of performance. So, take Cardiff and Swansea, our two biggest cities. You've got schools in those cities with comparative levels of free school meals. So, you could have really high-performing schools with a very small number of the cohort on free school meals. The difference between those performances in a single city\u2014so, that's the same local education authority and the same regional consortium\u2014you can see a massive change. There's one school I can talk to: their free-school-meal performance is 88 per cent. A similar school in the same city with the same proportion of children on free school meals, their performance is down in the 20 per cents. So, I think what's important is that we can't draw broad-brush conclusions. For me, the challenge is to go into individual schools and understand what was happening in that particular school that ensured that their children did really well. We've got one school in Swansea, their FSM performance at GCSE level 2 outperforms non-FSM pupils."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But we still need to rely on the trends from a distance. If we take your argument that 2017 was an unusual year and the trends up to 2016 were positive, in a few years' time, when we will be looking back in two years' time, how are we going to measure this progress, say, in 2019? What are we likely to see and what methods are you going to use to measure progress that way?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, you'll be aware that we are moving away from level 2 plus as a performance measure anyway because of the\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, what performance measures will you use?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "So, for the lack of sophistication around the level 2 plus, and for the unintended behaviours that that particular performance measure has driven within our schools. I'll be making a statement shortly to the Assembly around a new performance measure for schools. We were, at our most recent secondary heads conference, working with schools to develop that. What's important to me is that we have a more sophisticated model that looks at school performance for all children. What level 2 plus does is narrow, very much, the focus of schools on an individual part of the cohort, usually the C/D borderline, which is why then we have problems with the number of students getting a B grade or above. We have marked success in our schools by saying to schools that a C is good enough. Well, if a child gets a C but came to you in year 7 and they were destined to get an E, yes, indeed, a C is a success, because you've moved that child on; but, if that child came to you destined to get an A* and gets a C, then we haven't done a good job by that particular child. So, we need a performance measure that is much more sophisticated, looks at each individual child, tracks that progress, and measures the value added by that school in performance."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Last question: therefore, should we have confidence in the data up to 2016? Is there a lack of confidence in that data?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No, it's not a lack of confidence in the data. The data is the data. What I'm saying is, using that as a performance measure and an accountability measure within our school system may have been right for the time. I think it is now right to have a different way of measuring success in schools. I think that particular set of performance measures has driven certain behaviours\u2014not because Ministers wanted that to happen, but as an unintended consequence. I think we can work together with our school system, learning the lessons of international best practice, to develop much more sophisticated accountability and performance measures for individual schools, and, I should say, for the Government. So, you will be aware of my intention to issue the first national report card on Government performance later on this year. So, this is not about trying to avoid scrutiny. It's about trying to develop a more sophisticated way, which is in line with our national mission, where every child's education is valued, and where the impact of the school can be tracked more effectively."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Can I just ask, Cabinet Secretary, are you still holding on to your target of 37 per cent of free-school-meal pupils achieving the level 2 threshold?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, we're moving away from the level 2 threshold. So, that's the first thing to say. So, we will want to develop a new suite, in line with our new accountability\u00a0measures, as we go forward.\u00a0So, we will be absolutely continuing to track and evaluate the performance of free-school-meal pupils. When we announce our new accountability measures, I will be in a position to address how we'll measure\u00a0the Government's\u00a0performance, and national performance, going forward. But, given the fact that we're moving\u00a0away from level 2 plus, then we will need a different set of performance\u00a0indicators."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. The next questions are on looked-after children and adopted children, and I've got questions from Michelle then Mark."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Thank you. Good morning\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "I was to come in first, I think. I was about to ask about ICF consulting."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Go on then."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "I think my questions are first, but, Michelle, please do correct me if you were planning to come in before. The PDG for looked-after children\u00a0doesn't quite seem to have the degree of visibility\u00a0as the PDG for the free-school-meals. I think we had the MORI/WISERD survey\u2014only 15 per cent of primary schools and 23 per cent of secondary\u00a0schools were aware that PDG was targeted at looked-after children. I just wonder\u2014can you clarify on the record here what is the role of schools with PDG for looked-after children as compared to the regional consortia\u00a0in this field?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. I think it is absolutely fair to say that most awareness around PDG is around free school meals. There is less awareness around the availability of PDG to support looked-after children. I think that's probably in the nature of the cohort, so, there are more children subject to free school meals than are subject to being looked after. So, I think that's part of the explanation. A decision was taken in 2015 to regionalise PDG for looked-after children. My understanding was that the thinking behind that at the time was around a greater strategic deployment\u00a0of that resource and to try and drive a greater impact than how it\u00a0was being used previously. So, looked-after PDG is held at a regional level. We have looked-after children PDG co-ordinators\u2014they're in their second year this year\u2014to look at a regional deployment of that resource. And that resource can be done in a variety of ways, through individual allocation to a school to support an individual child, through to capacity building\u00a0for the whole system. So, for instance, if I give you an example, in Carmarthenshire, there's been a big emphasis on attachment\u00a0disorder and training teachers with regard to the impact of attachment disorder. Carmarthenshire happens\u00a0to be one of those local authorities\u00a0that does quite well in terms of attainment for looked-after children. But, clearly, I have\u2014not concerns. 'Concerns' isn't the right word. But I have asked officials to give greater scrutiny to how that resource has been used in the last year. Steve, on my behalf, wrote out to the system, setting out our expectations, but also advising them of the fact we will be asking very detailed questions of accountability for that money. So, what has that money\u00a0been used on and how can you account for the effect? But, Steve, maybe you can give some greater detail."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "I think the challenge that\u2014. One of the rationales\u00a0for shifting\u2014not that all the money stays in the region, but having a regional strategic\u00a0support\u2014was that, historically, the money was going directly\u00a0with that child to the school. Given the quite often rapid turnover of children in schools\u2014the very nature of looked-after children is they do sometimes move through foster parents\u2014historically, what happened, the money lands in the school, because, at that time in the year, when it's measured, the school gets the money and can spend it on some additional support for staff, but quite often that child moves on to another school and the money\u00a0doesn't transfer. Some schools will go through quite a number of years without having\u00a0a looked-after child and will not think strategically, 'How do I need to support them?' So, that was the rationale of the shift. In terms\u00a0of the implementation of the regional allocation, as of this financial year finishing, we are going into local authorities and regions to evaluate where they've located the resource, what the impact of that resource has been, so that is reinforced\u00a0and shared more widely."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And then, to reassure, it's not just internally that we're looking at this. We have a contract with an external agency to do an evaluation\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "That's ICF consulting."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes. Yes, so that was done in the autumn of last year, because, as I said, we had concerns about whether this was really having the effect that was intended. So, my expectation is that we will be in a position to receive that report later on this spring, and of course it would be my intention that that report would be made public for people to have a look at what\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "That was commissioned last autumn\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, in November 2017."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "November 2017."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "So, I'm hoping to have that published before the summer recess.

I will come back in if I have anything further to ask here after Michelle."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "\u2014both of you asked for these questions, and that's what the pre-meeting is for."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Michelle, I defer to you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Michelle."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Would you be open, Cabinet Secretary, to the idea of adjusting the eligibility of the PDG so that pupils who have been looked after or adopted at any point within a previous given period of time would attract the PDG, rather than only if they're looked-after on a one-off date?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "As I said earlier, in questions from, I think it was, Llyr, who was talking about concepts of concepts of Ever 6, we are constantly looking at how we can get that balance between focus and flexibility for this resource. Llyr opened with the question of, 'How can you absolutely ensure that these children are getting the money?', but then there's also a tension about how can you create some flexibility around the school's usage of the grant. So, we will look at that. I think there is the issue of where a school would know of a child that was looked after. Issues around adoption are slightly more sensitive, because we couldn't force a family to tell a school that their child was an adopted child. So, a family may be very open and very keen to explain that to a school, but we can't necessarily track as closely children who have been adopted, especially if that adoption happens before the child goes to school. We can't be in a position of forcing families to disclose this information if they don't want to, but we certainly can, as I say, look to strengthen our monitoring arrangements around PDG support for looked-after children and the impact that that's having. I just think we need to be a bit mindful of people's privacy in some instances. If they don't want to divulge that, it wouldn't be my job to tell a family, 'You have to let us know if your child is adopted.'"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Michelle."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Fair enough; thank you for that answer. The EAS consortium's approach to using the looked-after and adopted PDG is to use it as part of a broader approach targeted at vulnerable learners in general. What are your views on that approach?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I'm a great believer in if we can get it right for our most vulnerable learners, we'll be getting it right for all of our learners. I gave the example earlier, for instance, of attachment disorder, and, Chair, you will know that I have had conversations. One of the emerging themes for me, as I go around visiting schools, is the impact and the growing awareness and the growing numbers of children who have attachment disorder, and how schools are best able to respond to that in their children. So, for instance, as I said about Carmarthenshire, there's been a huge effort to address that in the school sector in Carmarthenshire. Now, that has a disproportionate benefit for those children, because you're more likely to see attachment disorder in children who are care experienced, because of the nature of the lives that those children have lived, but that doesn't necessarily mean that attachment disorder is exclusively found in those children that are looked after. It can be found in other families as well. So, that vulnerable learner, regardless of their background, will benefit from having teachers who are better trained, understanding and have intervention strategies in place to be able to address that need."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "I think it's also important to add that this is not one region's approach; this is across four regions, so the others\u2014. For example, ERW have run a significant programme looking at the impact of adverse childhood experiences on pupils, which has\u00a0enabled teachers to detect some of the impact of some of those and then considers some of the work they need to do within the school but also with other agencies. So, it is something that's\u00a0applied consistently across the four regions."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I was in Pil\u00a0Primary School recently where they use their PDG, both FSM PDG, and no doubt an element of PDG for\u00a0looked-after, for nurture groups. So, for those children who really, really find it very difficult to be in the main classroom, they can have that nurture group experience to address issues around emotional behaviour, feelings, and it gets them in a position where they are able then to join the main classroom because issues around behaviour have been addressed and they're in a\u00a0better position to learn. So, again, this is an example of how vulnerable learners in the wider sense can benefit."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Mark, did you have anything you wanted to ask?"}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Yes. Can I follow up on tracking adopted children? I entirely understand that you can't force parents to disclose that their child is adopted. However, my understanding was that, in England, there was a dataset with social services that was shared with schools in a way that I'm not clear is happening in Wales and how, if at all, that links to the pupil level annual school census data.\u00a0Perhaps sort of linked to that, isn't there an argument for making the parents of adopted children in the schools, potentially, with adopted children more aware that adopted children who\u00a0were previously looked after have this potential grant, and would they not be more willing to disclose this, at least confidentially to the school and Government, if they knew there was this upside of doing so?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We're actively looking at whether we should try and find a way of collecting this data, with the caveats that I just gave earlier. We can't force parents to divulge information that is a matter for them, nor would I want to. But there is an active discussion going on at the moment about whether we could create a dataset where people divulge this information and we can then track the children through. You're absolutely right. One of the ways in which we can often encourage take-up, for instance, of free school meals, especially in those communities where there is a sense of reluctance to apply for support\u2014even though people are entitled to it, there's a reluctance to do it; sometimes we see this in rural areas\u2014. Actually, appealing to the parents by saying, 'Actually,\u00a0this will mean more money for your child's school budget'\u00a0is a much more compelling reason why people will apply for it then saying, 'Actually, it's going to help you',\u00a0because they don't want to be seen being dependent, they don't want to be seen being helped.\u00a0But, if you say to them, 'Actually,\u00a0do you know that this means more money for your child's school?', they go, 'Oh, all right then, I'll fill in the forms now.'\u00a0So, you're right, I think there is something that we could do to make parents understand, in the round, that this has an impact. But we are actively looking at and discussing whether we could create a dataset around adopted children and how we can do that in line with data protection and data sharing. One of the things I am concerned about in the performance of looked-after children generally is how we can, across Government, work more closely together. We can't see the educational attainment of looked-after children just being a job of education. It's got to be a job of social services and the health service as well. There's got to be a joined-up approach to doing that. Now, officials were at the ministerial advisory group that's chaired by David Melding on prospects for looked-after children. They were there at the group last week. David tells me that the paper was very positively received by the group. I will be sitting down with David Melding to talk through what more we can do on the education side. I think there's really an appetite between me and the Minister for children to get a closer working relationship on this. We can't expect schools to do it on their own and alone.\u00a0And there are things that we can do out there in local authorities to help improve outcomes. It's not just about the PDG; it is about, when social services are thinking about a placement,\u00a0where does the discussion about where children are going to go to school\u2014when does that take place? Do we talk about the placement, move a child and then think, 'Oh\u00a0my goodness me, what are we going to do about the schooling?'\u00a0If you can imagine, the school could have been working really, really hard with a pupil to get them in a good place, to get them being able to access the curriculum, and then social services decide that the placement is being changed. So, we potentially lose all of that. So, a greater involvement in education\u00a0and better linked-up working in local authorities will help us with this. It can't be just the job of the PDG. If we think we can crack this with just PDG, then we're being delusional. It has to be a cross-government approach at a national level, and at a local government level as well, to get this right. Sometimes, data protection\u2014how can we break down some of these barriers between, you know, the school doesn't need to, schools shouldn't see, the entire social services report? Well, maybe the school does need to see some of that background information if they're going to have an impact for that child.\u00a0So, there's more work to do, but it cannot be just the job of education on its own if we're going to make a difference, nor can it just be the job of the PDG to make a difference for those children."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Julie's got some more questions on the impact on adopted and looked-after children."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes, before I go on to those, I just wanted to support, really, what Mark was saying about adopted children and how important it is, I think, that the adoptive parents feel able to speak to the school and to give information. Because certainly any evidence we've had from adoptive parents, and generally knowing about what adoptive parents do feel, is that they often feel that there's a degree of a lack of sensitivity in the school about the issues of adoption. I would certainly support some move towards ensuring that the atmosphere was open in a way that would encourage them to realise that it would be a help for the children if there was an awareness in the school. So, I just wanted to really reinforce that."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, and that would chime with what I hear from many adoptive parents. I'm just trying to be sensitive by saying we can't force people to divulge this information if they don't want to."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "No,\u00a0but they need to be given the opportunity."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes,\u00a0you're right. We need to make sure that those parents feel that they can discuss this with school leaders and classroom teachers and explore how best those individual children can be supported, and how best we can support parents. Because, again\u2014and I've said this a lot\u2014after the quality of teaching, the second biggest impact on a child's educational outcome will be parental engagement. So, being able to create an environment where adoptive parents feel very confident and able to talk about their children's education is absolutely crucial if we're going to get that parental engagement that we need for all of our children."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes. Thank you. Going on to looked-after children, you say that the latest data on looked-after children's attainment is extremely disappointing. Can you expand on that and what effect the PDG has had in this result, or not had?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well,\u00a0there's no getting away from it: the way in which we currently measure outcomes for looked-after children, the results are not good enough. It's a source of huge concern to me that we need to do better for those children. That's why officials are engaging with the group that David Melding is chairing, to make sure that education is integral to that group and it's not lost sight of. There's a discussion to be had about the cohort, whether it's right and correct to compare looked-after children to the main cohort, or whether these statistics are useful in any way. Sometimes as well\u2014this is not to make an excuse because, as I've said in my paper, it's extremely disappointing, but sometimes it can be really difficult. Because the cohort sometimes can be very, very small, it can swing the statistics to look perhaps more dramatic."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think, generally, when you look at how looked-after children do\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "It's not good."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "\u2014in\u00a0a much wider evaluation, they're not doing well, are they?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "They're not doing well. So, that's why we've got the review, the independent review, into the impact of the PDG in this area. This is why Steve is doing the work that he is doing with the regional consortia because, clearly, at the moment, we are not doing what we need to do for that particular cohort of children. I would not make any bones about that at all."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "I think we will not move away from the fact that these children need good GCSEs to gain employment, so we'll continue to measure that. I think we need to look at more nuanced evaluations of the data at a lower level. So, for example, there were significant improvements in terms of PDG pupils who got three and four good GCSEs but didn't get past the threshold. That's not to cover anything that is not working in terms of improvement, but we will look at the full range and\u00a0still hold on to the fact\u00a0that we have to look at a measure that relates to the likelihood of these children going on to further education and training."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "And then just one more question about the exclusion rates amongst looked-after children. They are, I understand, over six times more likely to be given a fixed-term exclusion. So, is there any way of trying to address this? Is the PDG used for anything to do with exclusions?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We can look at exclusions. We also have to read across about how the whole system works, not just the PDG element of the system. So, we know, for example, that 66 per cent of looked-after learners have some additional learning need, so we can't just look at it in terms of this particular source of funding; we have to look at it at a wider level of support. So, given that the majority of those children will have an ALN, how can we make sure that\u00a0our new ALN legislation and our new ALN regime meets the needs of these children? So, I think what we're looking at, again, is to say that it can't be just the job of the PDG. That's there as an additional level of support, but actually, we've got to get our ALN right. Unless we get our ALN right, lots and lots of these children are not going to get the support that they need day in, day out via that system. We do know that sometimes, if we're not addressing ALN, then we're not addressing behaviour issues that then potentially lead to an expulsion or potentially lead to non-attendance. So, we've got to look at it in the round and recognise the connections between the sometimes quite complex needs that these children have within the school setting, that are not just as a result of the fact that they're looked after; they have other needs as well."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "And investment in well-being\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Absolutely. Steve is reminding me that that's why well-being is part of the national mission\u2014to address issues around supporting children with their well-being, which is a way of keeping them in school."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. We're going to move on to Schools Challenge Cymru now. Llyr."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. I was just wondering what your assessment\u00a0is as to why some schools made progress and others didn't."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think we have to recognise that the 39 schools that were part of the programme were in very, very different places. So, I think one of the reasons why some schools did well was because their needs were not so complex, not so deep-seated and a certain level of intervention was enough to get them moving forward. Some schools had very, very different needs. I think, talking to those involved\u00a0in the programme, as always, we had some support advisers, challenge advisers working with those schools as part of the programme who were really, really excellent and really good, and were the right fit for the school and really drove the school onwards. We had other people employed in the programme who, perhaps, were less effective at driving change within those individual schools. So, what we have is a mixed bag of performance, again reflecting the very different challenges that those schools were facing, which led them to be chosen for the programme in the first place."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Yes, okay\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "Sorry. One of the other key additional factors was the extent to which there had been recent appointment of a new headteacher to that school just before the programme had started, because\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Leadership is all."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "And that was seen as a positive."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "A positive, yes. I think one of the challenges is that sometimes the time it takes to make changes in leadership can be protracted and can be a barrier, sometimes, to the speed with which you can move. But, for a significant minority of the schools, there had been recent new appointments of headteachers, which was seen to be contributing, when you looked at the evaluation, to the speed with which they were able to engage."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "The reason I was asking was I wanted to understand what lessons the Government is taking from that three-year investment, really, and how, maybe, you're applying some of those lessons to your wider school improvement programme. I know Professor Mel Ainscow identified six interconnected lessons, although I also note that the Cabinet Secretary didn't actually meet him for about six or seven months after coming into post. So, I'm just wondering, can you give us confidence that, actually, you are serious about taking lessons from Schools Challenge Cymru and applying them to the wider school improvement agenda?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, absolutely, Llyr. I don't think anything should be read into when I met the individual concerned, because officials were meeting the individual concerned. Individual challenge advisers were meeting with the regions, there was crossover work with the FSM agenda as well, and we are absolutely determined that best practice and those interventions that drove school improvement are embedded in the new support that we have via the regional consortia.\u00a0It's no coincidence that some of the best people that were employed by Schools Challenge Cymru are now in the employment of our regional consortia. So, those people that were really good and really made a difference don't work for the Schools Challenge Cymru\u00a0scheme any more, they work for our regional school improvement services. So, we're absolutely determined. The things that we have learned, as always, are around leadership. It is absolutely key and crucial to have strong, capable school leadership as a driver for change within the system. We're looking at systems and processes, so, actually, has a school got in place comprehensive systems of tracking and processes within the school?\u00a0We're looking at the teacher quality\u2014how can we ensure that we have got consistent strategies in place to drive up pedagogy and teacher quality in the classroom? Collaborative activity\u2014again, absolutely key. A school cannot see itself in isolation, and one of the key themes of the national mission is a self-improving system, so, collaborative working where schools are looking outside of each other, learning from best practice from other schools. So, there are lots of things that we've drawn from the evaluation that you will see as key themes running through the national mission, and, as I said, it's no coincidence that our really good people that were working in Schools Challenge Cymru\u00a0are now working for the regional consortia, being able to use that expertise not just for a very small proportion of our schools\u2014but that expertise is available to all our schools."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Although Estyn\u00a0has told us, of course, that you can't expect the consortia to\u00a0really carry on with that level of intervention and the same kind of intensity as was provided previously, so I'm just wondering\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "In what way?"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Well, we were told by Estyn\u00a0in evidence that they didn't necessarily think that we could expect the consortia to provide the same type of tailored support, and certainly the level of intensity with the improvement boards and everything\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, the improvement boards are carrying on, so the improvement boards still exist, and I would\u2014not that I want to argue with Estyn\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Well, feel free; this is your opportunity to do so if you\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "What I would say is that those improvement boards are staying on, and our schools categorisation system is used to identify the level of support. Now, if you're a red school, that gives you the entitlement to 25 days of support. That is more than you would have got under the Schools Challenge Cymru programme,\u00a0which would've been 20 days. So, actually, moving to this system allows us to really focus in on those schools that need that intensive level of support. And what's important for me, Llyr,\u00a0in this, okay, is that those schools are not necessarily just the schools that were in the programme. Our system now of challenge, advice and support allows us to target resources across all of our schools and across all of our sectors, because you'll be aware that Schools Challenge was only available to secondary schools, not available to primary schools. What our system now allows us to do, via the schools categorisation, is to identify schools, wherever they are in Wales and whatever sector they're in, to have that intensive level of support that they need to make improvements."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So, you're confident that that level of momentum is continuing through the consortia that was previously enjoyed by those particular schools, and you're also confident that there is minimal risk that they'll slip back to where they were, potentially, or at least part of the way back."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, actually, there are some really good examples of some of the Schools Challenge Cymru\u00a0schools making that sustained improvement now that the programme has come to an end. You only have to look at Tredegar, where we have seen continual improvement and moving up through the categorisation system. That school is now a green school, so they've been able to sustain their progress at the end of the programme. If we look at Armando in Eastern High School, again\u2014gosh, my goodness me, we had lots of debates in a previous Chamber about the future of Eastern. There was one person that said that Eastern had to be closed and that the only way forward for that particular school was for it to be shut down, but what we have seen is investment via Schools Challenge Cymru,\u00a0but ongoing, continual support from the regional consortium, and that school has come out of special measures. I pay absolute tribute to the staff of that school and that community that have done such a good job. So, I'm absolutely convinced that where we've got good\u00a0leadership and good support,\u00a0some of those schools are making continued, sustained progress even after the end of the programme. The challenge for me is for those schools that Schools Challenge Cymru didn't work for, and we haven't seen that progress\u2014how we can use our school improvement system now to continue to work with those schools to give them the level of support that they need to make a difference. So that's what my focus is on now: a whole-system approach, rather than choosing 39 schools to get that level of support, when we recognise that there are schools everywhere, potentially, that need intervention, support and challenge, and in the primary sector as well."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Okay. So, you wouldn't agree with a number of\u2014well, the near-unanimous evidence that we've had from academics, some of whom are Government advisers from consortia et cetera, that this kind of programme such as Schools Challenge Cymru would probably need about five years to really have the impact that it was intended to have."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "What I would say is that, from my understanding, from the outset, it was a time-limited programme. The schools were aware of that. There were no surprises that it was supposed to be a time-limited programme. Evidence from across the UK showed that school challenge programmes have differed in time. So, for instance, Manchester's challenge was a three-year programme. So, there's no consensus about how many years you need to run a programme for. The previous Minister was quite clear about the time-limited nature of the programme. That's not to say it was the wrong decision, because what's important, and an ongoing legacy of the programme, was the investment in regional school improvement capacity, because at the time our school improvement services and the regions were young, in their infancy. The ability of individual local authorities to make a difference, with so many local authorities in an Estyn categorisation, was limited, so one of the ongoing legacies of the programme is that significant investment of over \u00a310 million in the capacity of the regions to be able to continue this support and the school improvement work."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So, how disappointed were you that the money for Schools Challenge Cymru went back into reserves and didn't stay in your envelope, as you described it earlier? I presume you made a pitch for it. Did you make a case for that money to stay within your department?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Llyr, we are constantly having discussions with the Minister for Finance around support for the education budget. The Minister for Finance was quite clear that it was a time-limited programme. We were able to secure investment from the Finance Minister to be able to secure the programme and run it and phase it out to make sure there was transition support, so as we moved from the schools challenge programme into the regional consortia, there were resources to do that."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Did you feel there was a case to be made to add to the consortia's resources and be able to continue that level of support that schools had previously had?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, we did make resources available to the regional consortia to do that. As I say, from the outset, the previous Minister was very clear it was a time-limited programme. Certainly the schools that I talk to\u2014. And I want to be absolutely clear: I have visited many, many Schools Challenge Cymru schools. I have used that opportunity to talk to them about\u2014Heolddu being one of them, Hefin, which we went to visit, and Willows, for instance. I'm going to one this afternoon\u2014I'm going to St Illtyd's this afternoon, and I always take\u2014. I've been to Caergybi in Anglesey. I always take the opportunity to speak to those teachers about their experience of the programme and to understand and assure myself that they are getting ongoing support that they see as an appropriate level for them. I think I've done 19 of the schools."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Hefin on this."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "With regard to it being a time-limited programme, the previous Minister was clear that it was a time-limited programme, but it wasn't quite as time-limited as you've decided to be. Is that fair to say?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No, it was supposed to be a three-year programme at the most. So, there's no differential between when I decided it was time-limited and the expectations\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So the time limit was the same that the previous Minister put on it."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes. No change."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "But Mel Ainscow did tell us that there was a fade out in that third year\u2014not that people were giving up, don't get me wrong, but clearly there wasn't that commitment coming from Government because the decision had been made, and people felt that it was just fizzling out a little bit, and that impacted on the momentum."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I wouldn't characterise it as that. I think there certainly was a transition phase when we knew that the programme was moving and schools were moving into a different level of support,\u00a0but I certainly wouldn't describe it as a fading out\u2014not at all. As I said, we were aware that the programme was transitioning and we were determined to get that right for those individual schools, and to learn the lessons and, crucially, to be able to apply those lessons right across the board."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "I can see where the perception would come if a programme director like Mel was managing the programme right to the end of the three years exactly the same, and it falls off\u2014not a cliff, but it falls off, then the readiness for schools and the readiness in the system to hand over\u2014so part of the shift of focus was that working as a Government with the programme in those schools to working with the programme, those schools and the region. So, I think, inevitably, one party might see it as a decrease in terms of emphasis on their work, but it was necessary for the transition."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "But does that cast a bit of a shadow over the transition, then\u2014that one key player within that process felt as such, or are you confident that that was managed well and effectively?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think it was managed well, and we were very clear to recognise success where success has been achieved, but not to gloss over where the programme had not made an impact, because that wouldn't be good for anybody. There was a formal event to close the programme, which gave everybody an opportunity to get together, to be formally thanked, and for, as I said, congratulations to be given to those people who had really made a difference\u00a0and, crucially, key staff transferred over into the regional consortia. So, for those individuals, they were able to continue their work, but just be able to apply that work on a regional basis rather than just in an individual school. So, I don't see that there was any fading out, but there was a transition into a new system, and many of those key personnel transitioned into the system with us."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Have you got any figures for the numbers of staff who went from the programme into the consortia?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Not off the top of my head, but I can let you know."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. I've got Darren first, then Mark."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And can I just say, I met with some of them? I met with a selection of those people who had been involved in the programme to get their feedback on what they felt had gone right, and what they didn't feel had gone right in the programme. So, I took the time not just to meet the figurehead\u00a0of the programme, but actually to meet the people who were doing the work in the individual schools. Sorry."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Yes, I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned the figurehead there, I assume by 'the figurehead' you mean Professor Ainscow. And you've mentioned as well that you said you wanted to learn lessons from Schools Challenge Cymru, but he told us that nobody had been in touch with him since March of last year in order to have any sort of follow-up engagement, or to have a dialogue about his perspective on what worked, what didn't work, why there were failures in some areas and why there were successes in others. Why haven't you sought that level of engagement with the person who was responsible for running the programme?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I've had that conversation with Mr Ainscow. We had the evaluation of the programme. We've spoken to the people who were actually involved in running the programme on a daily basis in individual schools. We've spoken to the regional consortia. We've spoken to local education authorities. We've spoken to a wide variety of people to get their insight into the lessons learned, what was valuable and what was not valuable. So, a wide variety of people have been involved in those conversations."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "But you've hardly engaged with Mr Ainscow\u2014with Professor Ainscow himself."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "I would actually say that I have had meetings\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Since March of last year."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "Yes, since March of last year. I haven't got the exact dates for you. I've had discussions with Mel Ainscow, and my line manager at the time, Owen Evans, also had meetings and discussions."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "So, when he told us, 'Since last March, I literally have had no contact at all with anybody from Welsh Government', he was telling porky pies, was he?"}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "That's not my recollection. I'll go back and check for you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "If you could check and let us know, that would be good. Mark."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, well, I just talked about the celebration event to formally mark the end of the programme. My understanding was that it was July of last year, so people were engaged in that. And this idea that somebody has been ignored or frozen out is not how I see or how I regard that situation."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Mark."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "I have to say, with Professor Ainscow my impression was he took great, great pride in the work that he'd done with Schools Challenge Cymru, and I think he really enjoyed the engagement, the work and the positive relations with the Welsh Government. But I think there was just a degree of disappointment, perhaps, that at least he didn't feel that he'd been interrogated as much as he might have been about the lessons learned from the programme, and how perhaps to entrench those as well as possible with the regional consortia.\u00a0I just wonder,\u00a0Cabinet Secretary, if you could invite the professor in, perhaps to have a further debrief with you and take account of some of his thoughts and suggestions for what might help in this area."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, Mark, as I said, I just don't think it should be right to characterise this as a failure to engage with a single individual."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "I'm not characterising it that way, Cabinet Secretary."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "As I said, I met with him, Steve has met with him,\u00a0Owen Evans\u00a0has met with him, my special policy adviser has met with him and had discussions. So, there has been an ongoing dialogue. But, Mark, I hope that I have demonstrated since I took on this job that I am willing to work with a wide variety of people and to tap into their expertise if it can help me to deliver on the national mission. And if the advice to me is that we haven't sufficiently learnt the lessons, then I'll gladly have another conversation. What I'm saying to you\u2014and I'm absolutely confident\u2014is that we\u00a0have learnt the lessons, we are taking that work and the good practice forward, and we have done that with conversations with a wide variety of people who had a view on this, from individual schools that were involved in the programme, individual people who were working in those schools, local education authorities, some of which have been very scathing about the programme, I should say, regional consortia\u2014. So, the lessons, I am confident, have been learnt."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "I'm glad to hear that, Cabinet Secretary, but I still say that, listening to Professor Ainscow's evidence, there was a perception, at least from him\u00a0individually, that the programme should not be seen to be a failure, but a\u00a0desire that the lessons should be learnt and a feeling or exception, at least on his part, that there was more that he still had to contribute to the process. And just to take one particular example, I think he referred to the Schools Challenge Cymru advisers\u00a0being very successful in bringing in people who might not otherwise have contributed to this, and the regional consortia have had greater challenges in recruiting people, perhaps in some areas, of the same high standard of some particular individuals, but also from a wide range of different areas that the Schools Challenge Cymru do, and that there could be more to learn in that area as to how to support real excellence and a greater diversity of recruitment for those people. Is that something you could perhaps draw on his thoughts further about?\u00a0Because I think he does feel that he has more to say to Welsh Government to help in this area."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Firstly, can I say that I have never described the programme as a failure? I would understand, as someone who has put so much personal investment into the brand of schools challenges, that he would not want anybody to characterise that particular approach to school improvement as a failure. And I want to be absolutely clear that I have never described the programme as a failure, and I want to reassure Mr Ainscow of that. As I've said, gosh, my goodness me, if you saw my e-mail inbox and you saw the letters that come in, people are never shy\u00a0in coming forward to give me advice on what I need to do, what I need to do next, what I'm doing right, what I'm doing wrong, and, you know, our doors are always open to listen to people who have interesting things to say about how we can deliver our educational mission. So, people aren't slow in coming forward, I can assure you, with advice."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Julie."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Just very quickly. I'm sure the Minister is aware that Cardiff put extra funds of its own in to continue Schools Challenge Cymru advisers. So, obviously, they appreciated the value of the scheme, but it does query whether it should have gone on longer."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Julie, I think, to be fair, there are some people who think the scheme was absolutely fantastic. I've had feedback from people who didn't think the scheme was helpful at all\u2014in fact, they felt it was a hindrance. I'm very much of the view that the scheme worked really well for some schools in some areas and had less impact\u00a0in some areas. There is a mixed picture. What's important to me is that we understand what it was that led those schools to make those big changes, how we can\u2014like Mark talked about,\u00a0the expertise\u2014how we can keep that expertise in the system, and how we can apply\u00a0the lessons to all schools."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "The next questions, and the final questions, are from John. So, we're going to need succinct questions and succinct answers."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Some questions on regional consortia, Cabinet Secretary, and, first of all, the role that you believe they should play and how schools use PDG."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, it's an absolute\u2014. It's one of the things that I have been very clear to the regional consortia that I expect their challenge and support advisers to be asking schools about. So, one of the conversations that they need to have when they are in schools is exploring, with that school, how they are using their PDG, and how they're demonstrating an impact for those resources. So, it's a fundamental role for the challenge and support advisers in the regional consortia in their school improvement work. It's crucial."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "That sort of brings to mind some of the research that's been done on the role of the challenge advisers, Cabinet Secretary, which suggested that they're not actually challenging schools in that way, and that there's very little evidence of schools changing their decisions on the use of PDG as a result of any challenge from those challenge advisers. So, how would you respond to those findings?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, as I said, in my scrutiny of the role and success of our regional consortia, I specifically asked them about free-school-meal performance and the use of PDG within their particular region. I think there is increasing evidence to suggest that good use is being made of that resource, and I think that is being fed back into us. Estyn tell us that it's one of the areas of school expenditure that is closely linked to research and an evidence base. But, clearly, there is more to do, and that's why we have appointed the new regional advisers for PDG going forward, because we think there can be improvements in how this agenda can be supported at a regional level."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. So, you would recognise the findings from that research."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes. There's always more that we can do, and we are strengthening that role by the appointment of the new regional PDG advisers, so that individual\u00a0school challenge advisers know what they should be looking for, know what they should be doing, and there is a regional approach to good practice."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Could you tell the committee, Cabinet Secretary, how effective you believe the relationship was between the Schools Challenge Cymru programme and the regional consortia's school improvement functions, and to what extent it varied by region?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think it's fair to say that, on occasion, I have received feedback that there was a conflict between what was going on at an individual school under the school improvement programme and whether, then, they welcomed support from the regional consortia as part of that. So, in some cases, if we're being absolutely honest, there could sometimes be tensions between the two, but in most cases, the relationship was very, very positive and there was continuous feedback between the work going on in the schools under the programme and the regional consortia challenge advisers. But I'm going to be blunt and honest with people\u2014in some cases, it has been reported to me\u2014it's only anecdotal evidence; I haven't got hard and fast evidence\u2014that there sometimes was a conflict: 'We're a school challenge school so we don't need to participate or listen to any advice that's coming from the regional consortia.' Or, a local education authority said to me, 'We felt that we couldn't get involved in that school anymore because it was part of a different programme.' Those were isolated incidents, and, as I said, it's only anecdotal feedback. In most cases, the relationship was a very positive one."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "Just very quickly, I think that, across the board, it was more complex in the beginning, getting\u2014[Inaudible.]. But when the programme itself recognised that they needed to work with the regions, and the regions needed to work with them\u2014and I think Mel Ainscow in his evidence referred to this\u2014it strengthened after some early challenges. I think Mel Ainscow was working in a number of regions\u2014I can't remember which ones\u2014so he's established relationships\u2014[Interruption.] Sorry?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Central south."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "Central south. He has already been working in that, so I think it possibly had a stronger springboard in terms of the early working."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Because he already had relationships that he had already developed in that particular region. As always, with many of these things, it's about individuals and relationships."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Finally from me, Cabinet Secretary: in 2015-16, Estyn reported on regional consortia not sufficiently focusing on particular groups of pupils and tracking their outcomes\u2014for example, vulnerable pupils. I just wonder what you are able to tell us in terms of to what extent there has been necessary progress since 2015-16."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. Well, I think it's important to recognise that all four consortia underwent\u00a0monitoring visits in the autumn of last year, of 2017, which weren't reflected in the Estyn annual report for 2015-16. Estyn, through these 2017 inspections, have said that three out of the four regional consortia are making strong progress in their particular work, and we are continuing, as Welsh Government, to work with the other regional consortia to address the findings of the Estyn report."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "And that would include these particular issues."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, absolutely. The committee probably hasn't had an opportunity to see, but, only this morning, Estyn has released a report on more able and talented, and has positive things to say in the field of more able and talented, which was being asked about earlier by Members\u2014you know, evidence of improved working and support in that particular arena. But, again, we need to ensure a consistency across all the regions, and that the findings of Estyn's most recent reports into regional performance are followed through."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. As we've got a couple of minutes left, if I can just jump back to the issue of practical uses of the PDG\u2014because it's the only thing we haven't really covered and it would be good to get on the record\u2014can I ask to what extent you'd like to see the PDG used to track the progress of eligible pupils? And the committee's heard that there are several different tracking systems and tools used by schools. To what extent is that an issue to do with what the Welsh Government is promoting? Or is it down to consortia or individual schools? And do you think there needs to be a more centralised push on how the tracking is undertaken?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Firstly, can I say it's absolutely crucial that we track performance, absolutely crucial? That's the bedrock. We don't dictate to individual schools the nature of the system that they should employ in their school. There are a number of different programmes that allow schools to do this, but we are absolutely clear, and best practice and evidence shows us, that individual pupil tracking is key and crucial. And, as I said in the beginning, where we weren't tracking pupils at all, initial investment in PDG was used to establish these systems within schools. Again, one of the outcomes from the schools challenge review, and one of the lessons learnt, was, again, the importance of individual tracking of pupils throughout their school career. But we don't dictate a single system."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "But the principle is a really important one."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, and you don't think there's more scope to look at what the best system is that can be recommended to schools."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "That's not something we're actively looking at. I am actively looking at developing a Welsh toolkit around good practice, evidence base and research. At the moment we use the Sutton Trust toolkit, which is fine and excellent, but we are having active discussions about whether we're in a position, now, to look at developing a suite of a Welsh toolkit to support this agenda, and that's under active consideration."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Well, we've reached the end of our session. Can I thank the Cabinet Secretary and the officials for attending and for answering such a wide range of questions? As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for coming."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Thank you very much."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Okay. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Children and Social Care on Families First funding. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education, updating us on the supply teacher issue. Paper to note 3\u2014another letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education, providing further information following our meeting on 15 February. Paper to note 4 is a letter from the WJEC on availability of textbooks. Paper to note 5\u2014a letter from Qualifications Wales, also on availability of textbooks. And paper to note 6 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education to the Children's Commissioner for Wales, following up on the dialogue that they've been having about our inquiry. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Item 4, then, is for me to propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting. Are Members content? Thank you."}]}

Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.))", "content": "I call the meeting to order.  Welcome to the third meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Pursuant to the order of reference of Monday, April20, the committee is meeting for the purposes of considering ministerial announcements, allowing members to present petitions, and questioning ministers of the crown, including the Prime Minister, in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic. I understand there's an agreement to observe a moment of silence in memory of the six members of the Canadian Armed Forces who lost their lives last Wednesday in a helicopter crash off the coast of Greece.  We'll return to order. Colleagues, we meet today to continue our discussion about how our country is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. As we do, Canadians, like everyone around the world, are doing their best to live their lives until things improve. Meanwhile, as we look towards the future, I believe that it is also important to remember our past and to continue to mark the important moments in our shared history. At this very moment, the Dominion Carillonneur, Dr. Andrea McCrady, is performing a special recital to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands by the Canadian Forces. In May 1945, Canadian Forces played a major role in liberating the Dutch people from Nazi occupation. May 5 is now a national holiday in the Netherlands that commemorates the event and the great friendship that now exists between our two countries. Today's meeting is taking place by video conference. The proceedings will be made available via the House of Commons website. Please be aware that the webcast will always show the person speaking rather than the entire committee. Let me remind you that, as in the House or in committee, members may not take photographs of their colleagues or film the proceedings. In order to facilitate the work of our interpreters and ensure orderly meetings, I will outline a few rules. Interpretation of this video conference will be done as it is at normal committee meetings and in the House. At the bottom of your screen, you can choose floor, English or French. As you have seen, I change as I am speaking. I have now switched over to English in order to speak English. If you look at the bottom, you have a little flag that indicates whether it's English or French, and that's how we will be speaking. It makes it easier. That was where we had a little bit of a glitch in the last session. I understand that there are no statements by ministers. We can now proceed to presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes.  I would like to remind members that petitions presented during a meeting of the special committee must already have been certified by the clerk of petitions.  In addition, to ensure that the petition is considered to have been properly presented, the certificate of the petition and each page of the petition for petitions certified in a previous Parliament should be emailed to the committee no later than 6 p.m. on the day before the committee. I thank all the members for their usual co-operation. Thank you all. Now we'll proceed to presenting petitions. Our first petition comes from the honourable member for Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, Mr. Genuis."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC)", "content": "Mr. Chair, I'm pleased to be presenting two petitions today. The first petition is with respect to government Bill C-7. Petitioners raised concerns that this bill removes safeguards from the current euthanasia regime. It includes removing the mandatory 10-day reflection period and the number of required witnesses who will witness a person's consent. The petitioners urge the House of Commons to immediately discontinue the removal of safeguards for people requesting euthanasia, and to put in place additional measures to protect vulnerable people. This would require that bill to be amended or not passed. The second petition is with respect to Senate public bill S-204. This is on organ harvesting and trafficking. Petitioners call on members of the House, and hopefully the Senate as well, to support Bill S-204, which would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It would also create provisions under which a person could be made inadmissible to Canada if they had been involved in organ harvesting or trafficking. Thank you very much."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Thank you. I want to remind all the members that there are specific headsets that have been mandated to all of us. If you don't have one, please talk to your IT ambassador and they will get one to you as quickly as possible. The reason for them is not so much for what you hear, but that our interpreters are working and there are work conditions that really make it difficult. Part of that is not having the appropriate boom on your headset, which will make it very difficult for them to hear and interpret for our members. Now we go to the member for BeachesEast York, Mr. Erskine-Smith."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Nathaniel Erskine-Smith (BeachesEast York, Lib.)", "content": "Mr. Chair, I had to learn how to tie my tie all over again. It's been so long. I want to thank Jenna Robar, who's led this petition e-2453. The petitioners have noted that there are approximately 60 indigenous languages in Canada and that 2019, last year, was declared by the UN to be the year of indigenous languages. They draw attention to article 13 of the UNDRIP and to the TRC's calls to action numbers 13 to 16. Fundamentally, they call upon the Government of Canada to recognize indigenous languages as being official languages of Canada and to have each language recognized nationally, with implementations on regional and provincial levels, acknowledging that many regions have different languages."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Eric Duncan (StormontDundasSouth Glengarry, CPC)", "content": "Mr. Chair, I am proud to present a petition on behalf of one of my constituents, Myles Lynch of St. Andrews West in my riding. Myles made history as the first Canadian ever to survive three double-lung transplants. Myles lives with cystic fibrosis and has had three lung transplants in the last five years, and he's only 22 years old. Myles created a documentary called 8 Thousand Myles, which had a few showings in my riding. It documented his journey across Canada. One thing Myles has been advocating for is the creation of a national opt-out program for organ donation. Myles asked me how he could help raise awareness of that issue. I mentioned to him e-petitions online and getting people across the country to sign them. I am proud to have this certified today, with 1,318 signatures, asking the Standing Committee on Health to launch a study into the feasibility of the creation of a national opt-out program. I give kudos to Myles not only for his strength personally but also for his advocacy for others and for saving lives in our country by advocating for a better and an improved organ donation system. Kudos to Myles. I'm proud to present this petition today."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Peter Julian (New WestminsterBurnaby, NDP)", "content": "Mr. Chair, I'm very pleased to present this certified petition on behalf of several dozen residents of Toronto, Mississauga and Brampton, Ontario, who add their voices to those of the thousands upon thousands of Canadians who have signed similar petitions. Given that Canadians are living through unprecedented, catastrophic climate events, and at the same time our society, as you know, is suffering from worsening social and economic inequalitieshalf of Canadian families are only $200 away from insolvency in any given monthand particularly given the pandemic that we are currently experiencing, these petitioners are calling on the Government of Canada to support motion M-1, a made-in-Canada green new deal that I am presenting in front of the House of Commons. It calls on Canada to take bold and rapid action to tackle the climate emergency, and to put in place a shift to a clean and renewable energy economy."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Gord Johns (CourtenayAlberni, NDP)", "content": "Mr. Chair, it's an honour to table a petition on behalf of constituents from CourtenayAlberni. They are concerned, obviously, about fentanyl-related deaths. Over 12,000 Canadians have died over the last four years due to fentanyl-poisoned sources. They cite that the current war on drugs has been costly and grossly ineffective; that it has resulted in widespread stigma towards addiction and against those who use illicit drugs; and that criminalization of particular substances has resulted in the establishment of a drug trade that now trafficks dangerous and lethal products such as fentanyl. They are citing that regulating to ensure safe sources, with proper measures and bylaws, will reduce the criminal element associated with street drugs. Problematic substance use is a health issue and is not resolved through criminalization of personal possession and consumption. They are calling on the Government of Canada to declare the current opioid overdose and fenanyl poisoning crisis a national public health emergency under the Emergencies Act. They are calling for the government to reform current drug policy to decriminalize personal possession, as has been done in Portugal and other countries, and to create with urgency and immediacy a system to provide safe and unadulterated access to substances so that people who use substances experimentally, recreationally or chronically are not at imminent risk of overdose due to a contaminated source."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Brad Vis (MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon, CPC)", "content": "Mr. Chair, I'm presenting a petition today that contains the concerns of Canadians in my riding with the government's approach to firearms legislation and regulation. The petition highlights that the Liberal government's December 5, 2019, Speech from the Throne contains numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation; that the term military-style assault rifles is a political phrase undefined in Canadian law; that municipalities are constitutionally unable to enact criminal law to ban handguns in their jurisdictions; that the experts, including chiefs of police, agree that banning firearms and requiring law-abiding gun owners to follow more unnecessary red tape will not increase public safety; that the majority of guns used in violent crimes are smuggled into Canada from the United States; and that the Liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs, drug traffickers and illegal gun traffickers responsible for violence in our communities. The petitioners in MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon are calling on the government to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed, RCMP-vetted Canadians; and to focus our limited resources on anti-gang enforcement, on reducing the involvement of at-risk youth and gangs, on mental health and on providing the Canada Border Services Agency with the tools they need to do their job effectively."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Very good. That's all for petitions today. We will now proceed to the questioning of ministers. I would like to remind honourable members that no member shall be recognized for more than five minutes at a time and that members may split their time with one or more members by so indicating to the chair. Ministers responding to the question should do so by simply turning on their mike and speaking.

Although we are right in the middle of a pandemic and the government has agreed to set aside all parliamentary business in order to concentrate solely on eliminating the virus in Canada and its impacts, the Prime Minister is deceiving Canadians by introducing measures to punish law-abiding firearm owners. Why?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister)", "content": "Mr.Chair, I feel that all Canadians were affected by the massacre in Nova Scotia. Once again, too many families are facing tragedy and tremendous grief. During the last election campaign, we promised to ban military-style assault weapons, and that is exactly what we have done. We will be working with members from all parties in order to continue strengthening gun control. It is a shame that, once more, the Conservatives do not want to strengthen gun control in the country."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus", "content": "Mr.Chair, I understand the Prime Minister's reply. However, I would like to know whether he considers that, with this order in council, organized crime, street gangs and other criminals are simply going to turn in their weapons."}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "This is indeed only a first step, but it is an important one. We are doing other things to eliminate or restrict handguns in our municipalities, to strengthen the control at our borders, and to implement other measures. I am pleased to hear the hon. member speak of those measures, because we are going to work together in the House to strengthen gun control. I hope that the Conservative Party will be part of that discussion in a positive way, in order to keep Canadians safe."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus", "content": "Mr.Chair, I can simply say to the Prime Minister that the Conservative Party has always been committed to battling criminals, not law-abiding citizens. Speaking of criminals, we know that, even before the pandemic, the Prime Minister had asked the Parole Board of Canada to release prisoners more easily and more quickly. Now we are learning that, because of the pandemic, some releases are happening very quickly. The Minister of Public Safety told us that the people were approaching the end of their sentences or were older, but we are learning in the media that some dangerous criminals are being released. Can the Prime Minister give us an explanation?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "The protection, the safety and the health of all Canadians are important for the government. This is why we have taken additional measures in our correctional services to ensure that guards and inmates are protected. We have indeed opened the doors to some more speedy releases, but only in very specific cases that present little or no danger for Canadians. We have managed to find the right balance. We must protect Canadians and we must also ensure that they are safe. Those two things go hand-in-hand."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus", "content": "So is the Prime Minister confirming to us that no dangerous criminals have been precipitously released so that they do not have to experience COVID-19 within the walls?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "There are very strict rules and principles to ensure that people posing a threat to society are not released."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Mr.Paul-Hus, you have one minute left."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus", "content": "Thank you, Mr.Chair. The Chinese government has not been transparent with the rest of the world about the coronavirus. Australia asked for an in-depth investigation, but has received threats from the communist regime. Is Canada going to stand by its allies in the Five Eyes and demand that the Chinese government be completely transparent?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "We continue to stand in solidarity with our allies, including the Five Eyes, as they have stood in solidarity with Canada in terms of the two Canadians who have been unjustly detained for a long time in China. In the coming months and years, we expect to obtain answers to all our questions about the origin of this pandemic, including questions that are important for China. At the same time, we are going to work hard to ensure that all Canadians have the equipment and the protection they need to get through this pandemic."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We now move to Mr.Blanchet."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet (BeloeilChambly, BQ)", "content": "Thank you, Mr.Chair. I am sorry that I do not have my official headset. I was elsewhere, and I did not bring it with me. I hope that you can still hear me properly. For some days, discussions have been going on between people from the Bloc Qubcois and people from the government with a view to collaboratively coming up with a proposal for seniors in Quebec and Canada. The gist of our proposal is to temporarily increase the old age security by about $25per week, or $110per month. By the way, I hate the term \"old age security. I prefer \"senior security. The discussion has been going on for some time and it's a proposal that we made in the election campaign. We are asking for it to be done at this point, at least temporarily. Parliament stopped sitting in the middle of March. We are now in May, and seniors still have nothing. They are impatient themselves, and we spend a good part of our days answering them. Given that impatience, I realized I should not be the one answering them, it should be the Prime Minister. So here is my question for the Prime Minister: what are you doing to seek a solution that will increase the purchasing power of seniors in Quebec and Canada in the very short term?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Clearly, seniors need support and significant services from us because of COVID-19. Our priority was to implement income replacement benefits for workers who have lost their jobs because of COVID-19. Then we announced different measures, including measures for seniors. The most vulnerable seniors are going to receive reimbursement of the GST, which will help them very quickly. We have also reduced by 25% the minimum amount that must be withdrawn from registered retirement income funds. We have also channelled $9million through the United Way, to help the most vulnerable seniors. Absolutely, I recognize that more must be done. I am very pleased that we have been able to work with other parliamentarians, including those in the Bloc Qubcois, to hear these concerns and to find the best way to help seniors in the short term. In terms of the pandemic, they have concerns about their physical security, but also about their financial security. We will have more to say about this soon."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet", "content": "In the last few hours, the Prime Minister has indicated that he could need the cooperation of other parties, including the Bloc Qubcois, on a completely different matter. We are very open to that discussion, but we want the same openness when we are asking for something to serve the people of Quebec. The cost of a basket of groceries has increased for seniors, as it has for everyone else. It's true for all seniors over 65years old, of course. The current old age pension represents less than half of the Canada emergency student benefit. It represents less than one third of the basic Canada emergency response benefit. Seniors in my constituency, as in any other of the 338constituencies, are asking what we are doing. They are asking how there can be nothing for them. When will there be something for them? I want to be able to give them an answer of some kind. What is the Prime Minister's answer? I will repeat it to them."}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "There will be announcements in the coming days on the way in which we will be able to help seniors, particularly the most vulnerable seniors. We recognize that the cost of a basket of groceries is increasing for everyone. That is why we have to do better for our seniors. There are horror stories, whether about the CHSLDs, or about our most vulnerable seniors across the country. Far too many families are experiencing tremendous grief. There are seniors who are alone, seniors who are afraid of falling ill without ever seeing their grandchildren or their children again. We have to be there for those who belong to that great generation that fought for us during the second world war. Now we have to fight for them in their homes. That is exactly what we are going to do."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We'll go to the next question. Ms. Collins."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Laurel Collins (Victoria, NDP)", "content": "Mr. Chair, every day I hear from people who are struggling to pay their bills and to keep a roof over their head. Instead of making sure that Canadians get the help they need, the government has created complicated programs that are still letting people fall through the cracks. If the Prime Minister won't commit to a universal benefit, will he at least commit to removing the restrictive eligibility criteria that are leaving the most vulnerable people behind?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Mr. Chair, we knew, when this pandemic hit, that we needed to help Canadians who were suffering from coast to coast to coast, particularly the most vulnerable. That is why we moved forward rapidly with the Canada emergency response benefit, which has helped over seven million individual Canadians and has made a huge difference. We had to move very quickly to get this money out to people, and that is exactly what we did. We also recognized that there would be a need to do more. That is why since that moment, we have continually worked on reaching out to the most vulnerable and supporting them as well. We have more to do, but we knew that targeted approaches were what was most needed."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Laurel Collins", "content": "Mr. Chair, the government continues to leave people behind. I spoke to a woman in my riding who was homeless last year. She recently found a job and a place to live. However, because she didn't make $5,000 last year, when the pandemic hit she didn't qualify for any benefits. She didn't qualify, but she is one of the people who need it the most. I'm wondering why the Prime Minister doesn't think she deserves our support."}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Mr. Chair, our focus throughout this crisis has been on helping the most vulnerable with targeted measures that will lift Canadians out of poverty and will support them. Over the past five years, we've lifted over a million people out of poverty in this country, and we've continued to put the most vulnerable at the heart of everything we're doing. We will continue to. We've put significant investments forward to charitable organizations and foundations that are helping the most vulnerable. At the same time, we will continue to look for more ways to help even more than the seven million Canadians who successfully receive the CERB. We recognize there's more to do, and we will continue trying to do everything we can in this unprecedented situation."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Laurel Collins", "content": "Mr. Chair, the government is weirdly committed to eligibility criteria that result in regular people not getting the support they need, but not so committed to criteria for corporations and billionaires who get our help. If a company is cheating the public, using offshore tax havens not to pay its fair share, it should not be eligible for government bailouts or benefits. Other countries, like Poland, Denmark and France, have made this commitment, and if they can do it, so can we. The Prime Minister said one thing one day and another the next. Will he commit now that if a company has money in offshore tax havens, it will not receive public funds?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Mr. Chair, the measures we've put forward are focused on helping workers who lose their jobs, regardless of the companies they work for. It is a shame to hear the NDP, which used to be the party of workers, choosing to judge workers by which multinational they work for. We have moved forward with a wage subsidy such that the employers are obliged to pass every single penny on to the workers. That is not help for the companies. That is help for the workers, and that has been our focus all the way through: ordinary Canadians who need support because they are unable to work because of COVID-19. That has been our priority, and that is what Canadians need right now. Of course, we continue to have very strong measures to fight against tax avoidance and tax evasion. We spent a billion dollars to strengthen our  Ms. Laurel Collins: Mr. Chair, can I ask my last question?  Right Hon. Justin Trudeau: We will continue to do that."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "I'm just going to pause the time for a moment. I want to remind honourable members that we're trying to stay within committee rules, which state that the length of a question and the length of an answer should be approximately the same amount of time. I just want to remind our members of that. I'll go back to Ms. Collins. She has about 45 seconds left, and hopefully that's about half and half for the question and the answer. Ms. Collins."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Laurel Collins", "content": "Thanks so much, Mr. Chair. My last question is about housing and homelessness. My community was facing a crisis long before the pandemic hit, and now people who are living on the streets or in parks don't have the luxury of following public health advice and just staying home. In Victoria, the province and the municipality have stepped up with solutions to house people, at least for the short term, in local hotels. Will the federal government respond to this immediate crisis and provide the needed investments in long-term, stable housing?"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "The right honourable Prime Minister, in 25 seconds or less, please."}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Yes, Mr. Chair, we have moved forward with a historic national housing strategy that puts $40 billion toward housing. Working with partners, we have reduced poverty by over a million people in this country, but there is more to do. We are reducing homelessness by half with historic investments. We recognize that during this pandemic there's even more to do for vulnerable Canadians, and we are partnering with orders of government to make sure that happens."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Jol Godin (PortneufJacques-Cartier, CPC)", "content": "A point of order, Mr.Chair."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Order. Mr.Godin has a point of order."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Jol Godin", "content": "Mr.Chair, I cannot hear the French interpretation. Could we please check so that I can hear in French what the Prime Minister is saying?"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Okay. Can we check that?"}, {"speaker": "Mr. Jol Godin", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "I can try speaking English. I believe I was on the English tab, as is important. Are you hearing the translation now?"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "That is exactly what the issue was. I just want to point that out to all the members. I'm speaking English right now and I'm on the English toggle at the bottom of the screen. It does create a bit of a disjoint when we're speaking, but it's the way to get around that so we have interpretation that works for everyone. The next question will go to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Scheer."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition)", "content": "Mr. Chair, as this is our first opportunity to meet in any forum, I want to take this opportunity to express my condolences to the families of the brave men and women who lost their lives in the helicopter crash. I know that I speak for all parliamentarians when I extend our sympathy to their families and loved ones. Mr. Chair, I want to raise with the Prime Minister an issue that I've raised several times before, and that is a gap in the wage subsidy program. There is a company in my riding that employs thousands of people across the country. Last year, they acquired another company. Those companies separately would qualify for the wage subsidy, but because of rules that the government designed, together they do not. Even though collectively they have experienced a massive drop in revenue and would otherwise be eligible, so far they've been unable to get confirmation that they will be able to access the program. As a result, thousands of jobs are threatened. Will the Prime Minister be able to deliver some good news to people who work for Brandt Tractor all across the country?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "I thank the honourable member for his question and for his advocacy for his community and businesses in his riding. As I told him when we spoke directly, Finance officials have been directly in contact with the company in his riding. We recognize that there are particular elements in regard to this company that are challenging around application for the wage subsidy, but I know that Finance officials are working very hard to try to make sure that everyone who needs the subsidy gets it, so that the workers in his community can get the support they need."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Andrew Scheer", "content": "The Prime Minister knows that there are many companies across the country that fall into this category as well, so we're hoping for some good news. Just flagging the time and date, it is well into May now and important decisions have to be made in very short order. There are other aspects of the government's plans to help get people through this crisis that are also causing people to fall through the cracks. The plan to help businesses with rent applies only after a business has lost 70% of their revenue. As provinces start to open up, many companies are going to be faced with a very difficult decision of operating at perhaps 35% or 45% of regular revenues. They will not be able to access these programs and, in many cases, there is going to be a disincentive to reopen and put people back to work. Will the Prime Minister amend these programs to provide for more flexibility so that more and more Canadians can start to return to work in the weeks ahead?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Mr. Chair, we are in an unprecedented crisis and we had to move quickly to support workers and to support families across the country, and that's exactly what we did. We're going to continue to work to try to respond to the reality that people and businesses are facing right across the country. I am eager to be faced with the challenge of how to ease off in these measures so that people can get back to work. We are getting closer to that point, but we are not there yet. We are still focused very much on giving the supports to workers and families that are so necessary in this time of crisis. As different provinces move forward towards reopening, as we look at different paths forward, I know that I will be able to count on all members in the House and, indeed, on Canadians from coast to coast to coast to figure out together what the best way will be to move forward on keeping us safe and restoring economic activity in the right way. That will be good to work on together once we get there."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We have about a minute left for maybe a 30-second question and a 30-second answer. Mr. Scheer."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Andrew Scheer", "content": "Mr. Chair, no one is disputing the need to move quickly. We are now in May, though, and these programs have been announced for weeks. Canadians have been accessing them. The problems with them have been flagged for the government for weeks as well, but we're also going to see an additional challenge, where people who are receiving the emergency response benefit, who may have the option to go back to work and work some hours, are faced with a hard cap of $1,000 a month before they lose the CERB. Conservatives are proposing a progressive system, a more flexible system, where people will be able to earn more without losing their benefits as businesses ramp up but before normal working hours are restored. Again, will the Prime Minister build in some flexibility to lift the restrictive ceiling on what people can earn before losing benefits so that it always pays more to work?"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "I believe the timer is telling all of us that the time is up, but I'll give the right honourable Prime Minister about 30 seconds to answer that, please."}, {"speaker": "Right Hon.

Our priority was getting support for Canadians right across the country with the CERB, with the wage subsidy and with other measures for students, for seniors, for farmers and for agricultural producers. That has been our priority, and that's what we have worked on. I hear the concerns that the Conservative Party has around disincentives. We are going to work with communities and with industry as we look to reopen, to make sure that people have opportunities to work and are not penalized for it. However, our overarching priority was allowing Canadians to be confident in their ability to stay home, care for their loved ones, buy groceries and pay their rent so that we could keep safe during this pandemic.

We've heard the Prime Minister admit that fixed incomes for some of them are down, rent is increasing and the price of groceries is increasing.

Happily, their pensions and their benefits are still flowing, unlike for so many of those who have lost their jobs, but it's still tough. We introduced measures  Ms. Marilyn Gladu: Which day?   Hon. Deb Schulte: at the beginning of April. People received a GST credit, a supplementary payment that was $400 on average for single seniors and $600 for couples.

My riding is on the border of Canada and the U.S. We see a number of inconsistencies in what is considered essential travel with regard to the U.S. and actually in the interpretation of different CBSA agents. While we have Americans coming over to buy cheaper prescription medications and to fish, individuals in my riding who are trying to get auditors over so that they can be approved for export businesses are being declined. We have people who have purchased masts from Canadian producers for their boats, and who want to come and pick them up, who are not being allowed to do that. People trying to sell plasma into the U.S. are being denied. When will they clarify the rules to the CBSA agents so that essential travel and trade and commerce, including individual commerce, is understood?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)", "content": "Mr. Chair, we have implemented very rigorous rules that have been well documented and understood by CBSA to stop all non-essential travel. Those measures have been very successful. We've seen a 99% reduction in international travel coming into Canada. At the same time, we recognize the importance of maintaining essential supply routes so that goods and services could reach Canada and we could put groceries on our shelves. We also recognize the important work that essential workers do on both sides of the border. We have provided CBSA with clarification. Their interpretation of those rules has been broadly consistent. I've heard from a number of our colleagues in caucus with concerns about individual cases. When we receive those inquiries, we follow up immediately.

Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)", "content": "Mr. Chair, first, let me say that we absolutely recognize there are businesses across the country of all sizes that are finding this to be extremely difficult. The intent of the measures we put forward is obviously not only to give individuals a bridge but to give businesses a bridge.

More than 500,000 businesses have already been approved for these loans, representing over $20 billion.

On April 3, the fisheries minister said opening dates would be determined by harvesters. Since then the minister has overruled the will of harvesters in Prince Edward Island and in the gulf who voted to start their seasons on time, but she has allowed harvesters from her own riding to proceed with their seasons as scheduled, giving them access to markets weeks before their competitors. This double standard is severely unfair and Atlantic harvesters are furious, as demonstrated during the protests on the Canso Causeway yesterday.

Bernadette Jordan (Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard)", "content": "Mr. Chair, when making decisions with regard to when seasons open, a number of factors are taken into account. They are complex decisions that take into account what is necessary for processors to be ready for the season, what is necessary for harvesters to be ready for the season, as well socio-economic impacts on the area. We're looking at all of those measures when we make these decisions. We do not make them lightly. They are difficult decisions to make. In the decisions we've made around the gulf, one of the main things we heard from all of those areas is that it was very important for them to start on the same date. That is why the decision was made to start on the 15th of May. We're looking forward to seeing the harvesters out on the water. We're looking forward to the product that they bring in.

It seems a little dictatorial, and I was just wondering whether you could clarify that, based on the Standing Orders."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "I don't think I threatened to use mute, but thank you for bringing that up. I am trying to keep the rules where the questions and the answers are equal, so that there are no interruptions on either side. That's how we're going to continue. I didn't use the mute.

Bill Blair", "content": "We have heard from health professionals, women's rights organizations, victims groups and the police and our unions. They're all very supportive of the government's measure to ban weapons that have no place in a civil society and were designed to kill people."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Rachael Harder", "content": "It's interesting that the minister is misleading Canadians in that comment because the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has actually said that a gun ban will do nothing of the sort, that it actually will not protect Canadians. So I'd be curious. How many criminals will see guns seized because of the changes that have been implemented by the Liberal government?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Yes, let's actually quote what the police have said. The Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police said that they support a prohibition on all military-designed assault rifles.

Absolutely no criminals will see their guns seized based on the Liberals' legislation that's coming forward because it actually goes after those who legally own and use their firearms.

Now I understand the Prime Minister has his food prepared for him at 24 Sussex Drive and then it's delivered to him at the cottage where he lives. Contrary to his privileged understanding, food actually originates with farmers. Now, they're in a crisis right now, which means that regular Canadians are actually at risk of not having food available for them at the grocery stores where they purchase theirs.

When we have farmers who produce for Canadians on a daily basis and they're asking some serious and some very important questions, and we don't even have a minister who's willing to come to the table and engage in this conversation, that's shameful. Several meat-packing plants have been forced to shut down because of COVID-19 and, as a result, farmers are forced to hold stock longer than expected. Cattle producers in my region are spending more than $60,000 a day to keep their livestock fed while they wait for processing plants to reopen. The amount that was announced today by the federal government is a drop in the bucket. It's a crumb. When will the government take this seriously and at least implement a set-aside program for those who are beef producers in Canada?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Chrystia Freeland", "content": "Mr. Chair, let me just say that I feel there is nothing shameful at all in having me, the Deputy Prime Minister, answer questions about agriculture.

On January 14, it convened a meeting of all provincial health authorities. In January, the Prime Minister convened a meeting of the incident response group, and in January we increased screening at all major airports.

In an interview with Grald Fillion, tax expert Andr Lareau, who specializes in tax havens, pointed out that $350billion Canadian is parked in just 12tax havens. Companies are using tax havens for financing, operations and intellectual property activities. Mr.Lareau also notes that the government is aware that all of this Canadian money is stashed in tax havens but is doing nothing about it. He said that it's time for Canada to tackle the problem given that it has a $250-billion deficit, and that if it doesn't act now to change things, it never will.

Diane Lebouthillier (Minister of National Revenue)", "content": "Mr.Chair, as soon as we took office, in 2015, our government made cracking down on tax evaders in Canada and abroad a priority. That's precisely why we put nearly a billion dollars towards that effort. I realize that my fellow member is impatient, but he has to understand that this is a very complex issue. Under our leadership, in three years, the Canada Revenue Agency has undertaken twice as many audits related to offshore tax evasion as it did in the 10years the Conservatives were in power. As we speak, the agency is conducting more than 50criminal investigations tied to international tax evasion. I repeat, this is a top priority for our government."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie", "content": "You're right, I am very impatient, because whenever I bring up the fact that companies are using tax havens legally, the minister misses the point and tells me that she is going after fraudsters. I am talking about the legal use of tax havens by companies. Since Parliament began sitting virtually, it's been mentioned a few times that Denmark and Poland have decided to deal with the issue. Even France's finance minister, Bruno LeMaire, said that companies with subsidiaries in tax havens would not be eligible for public assistance. We hear thePrime Minister and other government officials say all the time that the wage subsidies are going to workers, so I'd like to cite another examplebanks. The government is injecting huge amounts of cash into the financial system and repurchasing troubled assets in massive quantities, and yet, the five major banks in Toronto, alone, are continuing to save billions of dollars every year by artificially redirecting their profits to tax havens. This is unacceptable. This has nothing to do with wages for workers, and everything to do with the repurchase of troubled assets, cash flow and billions of dollars that the government could be going after. Is the government going to seize this opportunity to make the corporate use of tax havens illegal?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Diane Lebouthillier", "content": "Mr.Chair, our government is taking unprecedented steps through the Canada emergency wage subsidy measure to support businesses and workers affected by COVID-19. This is largely a trust-based program, and we will not tolerate abuse. Anyone who tries to bypass the rules will face serious consequences. Applicants have to designate an individual to attest to the truth of their claim. What's more, any employer receiving the subsidy who is deemed ineligible will have to repay the full amount. Anyone who abuses the program could face a fine of up to 225% of the wage subsidy amount and up to five years in prison. The Canada Revenue Agency also has a myriad of tools at its disposal to detect a fraudulent claim. As I mentioned, cracking down on tax evasion is a priority for our government."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Mr.Ste-Marie, you have about 30seconds to ask your question, and about the same for the answer."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie", "content": "Thank you, Mr.Chair. That's an excellent answer, but it has nothing to do with my question. The Minister of Finance has the power to fix the problem now. Although completely immoral, the use of tax havens by companies is legal under section5907 of the Income Tax Regulations. Through simple regulatory amendments, the finance minister could put an end to this kind of abuse. We are going to have a $250-billion deficit to pay off, and everyone is going to have to chip in, including the rich who are currently taking advantage of the system."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Diane Lebouthillier", "content": "Mr.Chair, thanks to a historic billion-dollar investment, our government has given the agency the resources it needs to do the job, and we are starting to see results.

In BonavistaBurinTrinity and across our country, our commercial fishery has seen many challenges and impacts. Last week, my colleague, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, announced an investment that will ensure resilience of the food system by allowing Canada's fish and seafood processing sector to safely and efficiently process, store, package and distribute healthy, high-quality products on to the plates of Canadians. The fish harvesters in my riding are fearful of what will happen within this industry and their immediate futures. They are facing a reduction in available markets and market prices.

We've already taken steps by making sure that the CERB is now able to be accessed by people who are seasonal workers. As well, we are making sure that people who are running out of fishers EI are also able to qualify for it. We also have made an investment of $62.5 million to support our processors to make sure they are able to be ready for the challenges that they are going to face because of COVID-19. We know there is more to do. We know that the harvesters need support. We are working with our partners across industry to make sure we're hearing what their major concerns are.

This is so important because, as my colleague has pointed out, all of our business, our economic activity, happens across the country. It happens across provincial and territorial boundaries. I would really also like to take this opportunity to thank the first ministers across the country. They belong to different parties, but everyone has really been able to put partisanship aside.

Now, two workers are dead, at least six more are in intensive care and COVID-19 is spreading like wildfire through these communities. There are over 1,400 cases. Yesterday, employees were forced back to work even though their concerns had not been addressed. On March 27, regarding the CERB, the Minister of Finance said that if workers don't feel comfortable in their work, if they decide to stay home, they can apply for the benefit, yet the website says differently.

To the question my colleague asked about workers, it is absolutely the case that no Canadian should feel they need to work in an environment that is unsafe, and it is also very much the case that any Canadian who is feeling unwell should stay at home.

Potato farmers in New Brunswick and across Canada are sitting on massive stores of potatoes that were destined for the restaurant industry, but due to the pandemic, they now have no customers. It's estimated that there is $300 million worth of potatoes still sitting in storage. What is the Prime Minister's plan for the helping farmers offload these potatoes so that they are ready for the 2020 season?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Chrystia Freeland", "content": "Mr. Chair, I think all of us as Canadians are proud of the great potato farmers across the country. We are aware that the coronavirus, by keeping us away from restaurants where we eat french fries, has had a profound effect on the market for potatoes. The program announced today by the Prime Minister and my colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, will be very helpful for potato farmers, including with the surplus food program that starts with a $50 million fund, and that"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We'll go back to Mr. Bragdon now."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Richard Bragdon", "content": "Mr. Chair, thank you. With an estimated $300 million worth of potatoes in storage, the announced funding from the government today simply doesn't go far enough. In 2018 the New Brunswick potato industry lost over $20 million. It is estimated this year that the financial loss will exceed $40 million. For many producers still recovering from the hit they took in 2018, another major loss is totally unacceptable. How does the Prime Minister plan to mitigate these shortfalls and allow farmers to continue to grow the food we so desperately need?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Chrystia Freeland", "content": "Mr. Chair, the honourable member spoke about farmers generally. The program today is $252 million, which comes on top of the broad range of other programs that farmers, of course, have access to. On potato farmers, in particular, I agree with the honourable member that this is a specific area of concern. I think all Canadians would like to see those potatoes not be wasted but be used, and that's why the $50 million for surplus food purchase is going to be so helpful."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Richard Bragdon", "content": "Mr. Chair, farmers across all agricultural sectors are hurting during this pandemic. The $16-billion beef industry is expected to take a massive hit due to the closures and reduced production of the meat-packing plants.

Chrystia Freeland", "content": "Mr. Chair, I absolutely agree with the honourable member that our beef, pork and poultry producers are absolutely essential for our country. I am very pleased as a Canadian that we have security that comes from being a country that produces not only enough food for ourselves, but also enough food to feed the world. That is why the $125 million specifically to support our beef, pork and poultry producers is going to be so helpful."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Richard Bragdon", "content": "Mr. Chair, the government's announcement of $252 million for the agriculture sector falls well short of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture's request for immediate government relief for farmers. The president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, Mary Robinson, put it today something like this: that if the farmhouse is on fire, the government has offered the equivalent of a bucket of water. This will not go nearly far enough to help those in a desperate situation. Does the government have a plan to offer more than just crumbs to keep the vital agriculture sector operating and providing the food we so desperately need? When will the government finally make those who literally keep our land and grow our food a priority in this time of crisis?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Chrystia Freeland", "content": "Mr. Chair, I don't know about the honourable member, but where I come from, $252 million is not just crumbs. I know that Canadian farmers don't feel that $252 million is nothing, either. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight two other aspects of the essential support for farmers that we announced today: the $77 million to support food processors, which will not only be important for the processors, but helpful for the farmers who produce products that go to them; and the $250 million that we would like to add to the Canadian Dairy Commission's line of credit to raise it to half a billion dollars, which will be very helpful to our essential dairy farmers."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Now we'll go to the next question.

Carla Qualtrough", "content": "Mr. Chair, any individual who has lost work for COVID reasons is eligible for the CERB, regardless of their personal circumstances. If you made $5,000 in the past year and are a resident of Canada, you qualify for the CERB.

The government's own findings on banning handguns and assault firearms state, In all cases the data does not conclusively demonstrate that these handgun or assault weapon bans have led to reductions in gun violence.

Bill Blair", "content": "Mr. Chair, I note with some interest that when we brought forward legislation in a budget in the last two years to increase the number of officers at the border, the member opposite voted against it. I'm very pleased to hear that she now supports it. Let us be very clear. The evidence is overwhelming that these weapons are designed to be used, and have been used, to kill innocent people. Countries that adopt sensible gun policiesplaces like New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdomhave all recognized that there's no place for these weapons in a civil society. We promised Canadians that we would act on that concern. There have been far too many people killed with these weapons, and even most recently, to honour and respect the terrible tragedy in Nova Scotia, the time to act is now, and we've acted."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Cathay Wagantall", "content": "Last week the Minister of Agriculture said, Step by step we are giving our farmers...the tools they need to continue their...work. On April 30, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture called on the minister to create a $2.6-billion fund to maintain food security in Canada. This morning, the Prime Minister announced $252 million, hit-and-miss, across the agriculture sector. With all due respect, this is a slap in the face to our farmers and the agri-food sector. Instead of being here to speak to this announcement, the minister has chosen to do a press conference. This certainly reveals how seriously the minister takes this virtual sitting and parliamentary accountability.

The $252 million of support is real and meaningful, and it is directed exactly where it is needed. It is directed at food processors, beef and pork producers and the dairy sector.

Bill Blair", "content": "Madam Chair, in response to that, I would simply remind the member that we have made it very clear that these weapons have no place in civil society, so we have prohibited military-style assault weapons that have been designed to be used to kill people and have been used to kill people. I would also advise the member we will bring forward legislation to deal more effectively at the border. We'll make significant new investments in border services officers and in police. We'll bring forward new authorities, new offences, new penalties to deal with people who smuggle weapons across the border. We're also bringing in new regulations for the storage of weapons to make it more difficult for people to steal these guns. To deal with people who purchase them illegally and sell them illegally, there will be new offences and penalties to make ensure that they face the consequences."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Blaine Calkins", "content": "The government previously has said that decisions like classifying firearms should be left to experts. The recent decision was purely political and it flies in the face of evidence-based policy. A legal opinion that's already been obtained says that the bore of a 12-gauge shotgun with the choke removed is in excess of 20 millimetres. That means every 12-gauge shotgun with a choke in it with that choke removed is now prohibited. That is the same firearm that Olympic trap shooters, Olympic skeet shooters, duck hunters and geese hunters all across our country use on a very regular basis. Why did the government abandon an evidence-based policy?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Madam Chair, I'm pleased to have the opportunity to correct the member. First of all, we have prohibited large-bore weapons, such as grenade launchers, but with reference to the 10-gauge shotgun and the 12-gauge shotgun, I would simply remind the member that the bore of a 10-gauge shotgun is 19.69 millimetres in width and the bore of a 12-gauge shotgun is 18.53 millimetres in width, both of them under the size for prohibition and therefore not covered in the new prohibitions that the government introduced on Friday. I'm afraid his expert opinion is wrong."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Blaine Calkins", "content": "Madam Chair, the opinion is that of one of the foremost experts we have in Canada when it comes to firearms legislation. If the entirety of the barrel length is considered, then the removal of the choke makes that barrel in excess of 20 millimetres. I would appreciate the minister clarifying that for law-abiding firearms owners. There is no plan for a buyback program in this policy, and law-abiding firearms owners are not able currently to surrender their firearms. Given this, and the fact that law-abiding firearms owners aren't committing any gun violence, what was the government's immediate benefit of making this announcement on May 1?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Thank you, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity to clarify. Along with the prohibition that we have put in place, we have also, using the order in council, established an amnesty period, but the amnesty period is non-permissive grandfathering of those weapons. They cannot be used, they can't be taken to the range for shooting, they can't be used for hunting, they can't be sold and they can't be transferred, so we have put in strong measures to ensure that these weapons will not be available for use. We have also put in an amnesty period that will allow us to bring forward the legislation and a budget in order to effect a responsible, safe and effective buyback program to remove these weapons from society. I look forward to the member's support for those measures as we go forward."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Blaine Calkins", "content": "Madam Chair, since January 1, 2002, any law-abiding citizen who was issued with a firearms licence by the government would have been cross-referenced with a continuous eligibility check 6,695 times up until May 1 of this year. How many times was this most recent mass murderer here in Canada checked against a criminal database since January 2002?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "As the member is probably aware, there is a very extensive investigation currently being conducted into that individual and how he acquired his firearms, and it's not appropriate to discuss that. However, I think what is appropriate is to recognize that the weapons that this individual had available to him are weapons that were not designed for target shooting or hunting purposes or any sporting purposes. They were designed for soldiers to kill soldiers. In the hands of someone who is intent on mass murder, they represent an unacceptable and deadly risk to Canadians, and that's why we have prohibited them.

For example, it is of utmost importance that Canadians practise social distancing. Social distancing can provide the most protection, in fact, when you're out in public or you're in another place where there are other people.

My question is to the Minister of Indigenous Services. First nations across northern Manitoba and many others across the country have been doing everything possible to keep COVID-19 out of their communities. Many here have implemented strict lockdowns or travel restrictions, but the federal government has done virtually nothing to deal with the chronic issues that have made them vulnerable in the first place, such as overcrowded housing and the lack of hospitals. We have to be very concerned about a possible second deadly wave of COVID-19. What is your government doing to support communities in the face of that possibility? Why isn't the government supporting the call for a ventilation centre in Berens River, a hospital in Cross Lake, a hospital in the Island Lake region? If the government couldn't act in time for this first wave of the pandemic, can it at least act in time for a potential second wave?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Marc Miller (Minister of Indigenous Services)", "content": "Indeed, Madam Chair, one of the reflections we have in coming out of this global pandemic is that we don't want to go into the next one with the same social determinants of health that have made indigenous communities more vulnerable and more susceptible to contracting and then spreading COVID-19. A lot of the historic housing funds that we have mobilized in order to address overcrowding in particular are cold comfort to those communities that are still finding themselves in overcrowded situations. In the staged approach to the epidemic and the onset of COVID-19, there are many measures that Indigenous Services Canada and as a whole of government we will deploy, including surge capacity, increased PPE, and nurses and doctors. Obviously, we are looking for a medical solution to a medical problem, and that is what we will spare no expense or resource to address as indigenous communities continue to face the looming threat of a second wave of COVID-19 as they start to relax some of their confinement procedures."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Niki Ashton", "content": "Again, Madam Chair, to the Minister of Indigenous Services, many of us across northern Canada are deeply concerned by the outbreak taking place in northern Saskatchewan, centred in La Loche. The outbreak started from a worker who came back from a work camp in Fort McMurray. These camps are making workers sick, and they are proving deadly for first nations and northern communities. These work camps put public health at risk during a pandemic.

Will you support first nations in their call for shutdowns during this pandemic to save lives now?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Marc Miller", "content": "Madam Chair, the situation in La Loche is a very pressing concern. Members won't be surprised to know that that number will only increase as the days go on and as we implement aggressive testing and contact tracing.

This is a situation that is very much evolving minute by minute, and it is something for which we have deployed additional resources, along with Meadow Lake and the Northern Inter-Tribal Health Authority to ensure that there is a health response to a health problem. Clearly, we need coordination with the provinces to ensure that we have a seamless approach"}, {"speaker": "Ms. Niki Ashton", "content": "My question referred to La Loche, but this is a broader issue.

Marc Miller", "content": "One of the things we see as we see the evolving dynamic and the potential spreads, particularly the fear of clusters as communities, provinces, territories may choose to relax certain measures, is the need to have a more targeted approach as to how the economy reacts and deals with it, particularly in northern and vulnerable communities. This is something for which we will need to have a serious approach, with both the Minister of Natural Resources and also our provincial counterparts, to make sure that we aren't taking hasty measures to reopen the economy while we're trying to protectand this is our most important goalindigenous communities from getting exposed and spreading COVID-19."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Niki Ashton", "content": "Madam Chair, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries.

I don't want to talk about the $1billion that the government used to track down tax cheats. I want to ask the minister why she isn't taking this opportunity to learn from countries that are putting an end to tax avoidance in tax havens, a legal but immoral practice in this day and age. Can she explain why she isn't showing leadership by convincing cabinet to change course and eliminate the legal measure known as tax avoidance, which enables companies to avoid paying taxes and put money in tax havens?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Diane Lebouthillier", "content": "MadamChair, as soon as our government took office in 2015, we made it a priority to crack down on tax cheats. Our government's historic investments of almost $1 billion have ensured that the agency can access the necessary resources for its work. We're already starting to see the results. As I was saying, I established an expert advisory committee to advise us. We've also been working on tightening the rules of the voluntary disclosures program. We've entered into country-by-country agreements that make it possible to share information. We're auditing four countries a year. We're working with the OECD. Currently, over 50 criminal investigations are related to international tax evasion."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends)", "content": "Ms.DeBellefeuille has the floor."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Claude DeBellefeuille", "content": "MadamChair, does the minister realize that she's being filmed and recorded and that she isn't answering my question? I don't want to talk about cheats. I want to talk about companies that use a legal mechanism to avoid paying taxes and to put their money in tax havens. I can see that she doesn't want to answer my question. I'll ask her another question. Can she tell me how many companies legally take advantage of tax avoidance in tax havens? How much money escapes taxation through this legal mechanism? The government could invest this money in its economic recovery post-COVID-19."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Diane Lebouthillier", "content": "MadamChair, I completely understand my colleague's impatience. However, she must understand that this type of issue is very complex. Under the former Conservative government, the issue wasn't a priority at all.

My next question is for the Minister of Finance. The Fdration de la relve agricole du Qubec and the UPA approached the Minister of Finance two weeks ago and still haven't received a response regarding the following issue. We know that many farms don't pay wages. As a result, these farms are being penalized because they aren't eligible for the $40,000 in loans available through the Canada emergency business account. To qualify for these loans, the farms needed a payroll of $20,000 to $1.5million in 2019.

The tourism ministry was one of the first and hardest-hit industries during this crisis, yet despite the Prime Minister's announcement over three weeks ago now of a plan to bring forward a tourism-specific aid package to help the businesses who employ millions of unemployed Canadians who work in tourism, there's still been nothing from this government. When will the government finally act to provide help to this nearly crippled industry?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Mlanie Joly (Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages)", "content": "Mr. Chair, obviously we know that the tourism sector has been deeply impacted. I had the chance to talk to many of the leaders in the sector, and clearly there's a lot of anxiety. We also had the chance to work with all the G20 ministers of tourism all together, and we know we have to act"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We'll now go back to Mr. Richards."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Blake Richards", "content": "I didn't really get much of an answer there. I hear a lot about talking and not much on action. Tourism-based communities like the ones in Banff and Canmore, which I represent, are tourism-based economies and have unemployment rates of 85% or higher. They also don't qualify for a lot of the programs because they're seasonal businesses and make most or all of their revenues for the year from May to October, so they're at risk of losing their entire season. I have a couple of very specific questions. Will the government consider making changes to the programs to make sure that seasonal businesses can get help? What does the government plan to do to help the tourism industry recover after the pandemic?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Mlanie Joly", "content": "Thank you. Obviously, the tourism sector has access to many measures, including the CEBA account, the $40,000 account. They also have access to the wage subsidy. They have access to rent relief. They will be having access also to funding through the regional development agencies, and we'll be coming up with the details soon. Of course, in my colleague's riding of Banff, which is a fantastic place and a tourism gem, they will have access to the support through WD, western economic diversification. If there are particular cases you would like to raise with me, I would be more than happy to talk to you to see how, on the ground, we can help the tourism operators."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Blake Richards", "content": "Mr. Chair, clearly the tourism minister hasn't been listening. She says she's talking to the industry. She's not hearing their concerns. What she just said does not address many of the concerns they have about being seasonal industries. It doesn't address anything about their concerns about the hard economic recovery they'll have after the pandemic. Let's try another minister and see if we can get some answers. Another industry that's very hard hit in my province and my riding is the oil and gas industry. It's another industry the Prime Minister has promised to help, but there hasn't been anything. Clearly there's a pattern here. The only so-called assistance there's been to help hurting Albertans in the oil patch has been measures to speed up the death of the industry that they work in. Will the Liberal government ever show any concern for Albertans? Will they bring forward a plan to preserve Canadian jobs? Will they put forward a plan to ensure the use of Canadian oil before oil coming in from places like Saudi Arabia?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Seamus O'Regan (Minister of Natural Resources)", "content": "In fact, Mr. Chair, the federal government has taken several steps in recent weeks that will meaningfully support workers and communities that depend on this industry. We have the Canada emergency wage subsidy, which covers 75% of an employee's wages for the employer. We have more liquidity for oil and gas companies through new loans of $15 million to $60 million from the Business Development Bank of Canada. We continue to step forward in our response to the impacts of COVID-19 on my province here in Newfoundland and Labrador and on Alberta and Saskatchewan. These three provinces are being hit by two crises at the same time, a crisis of demand for oil and gas on the world markets and of course a crisis of public health with COVID-19."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Blake Richards", "content": "Mr. Chair, a lot of these things we're hearing about aren't going to actually help the industry to recover. What we need to see is the government give the industry and the private sector the opportunity to succeed. Maybe what they could do is consider expediting the approval of billions of dollars of private sector projects that would put thousands and thousands of Canadians back to work. Will the government consider looking at ways that we can expedite projects? Will they look at ways that we can encourage the use of Canadian oil before the use of oil coming in from places like Saudi Arabia?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Seamus O'Regan", "content": "Mr. Chair, we have been working with our provincial partners. We have been working with businesses of all sizes in the oil and gas industry. We have been working with labour, concentrating on workers and concentrating on the companies that support those jobs to make sure that they remain whole and those jobs will be there for those workers. We're particularly proud of our orphan wells program, which was launched by the Alberta government in conjunction with us. It was launched last week. I am pleased to inform this House that the uptake on applications for that program is significantly higher than even we expected."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "That's all the time we have for questions today.

Secondly, new decisions made from the education ministry should be taken in the context of the wider Welsh Government response to dealing with this pandemic. Thirdly, communication with the parents and staff were crucial and they should be given time to adapt to the changes. Moreover, certain groups of children accessing more education within a school setting should also be considered.

Local authorities are asked to report any incidents where they were concerned about operation issues on the ground.

And indeed, if I could just begin by, once again, putting on the record my gratitude to everyone who is helping us get through this pandemic. There are a vast number of people who are keeping our school hubs open, looking after vulnerable children, and the children of key workers. Because of them, and their efforts, those key workers are able to carry on their critical roles in responding to COVID-19. I am extremely proud of the way that members of the school community have gone above and beyond. They have kept their schools open out of hours, over the weekends, on bank holidays, and Easter. And it is really heartening and humbling to see the way that they have responded to this crisis. And there are teachers, teaching assistants, and many others, who are helping our children and their parents to keep learning at home. I know that home schooling isn't easy, so I want to say also thank you to parents and carers for their efforts at this time. By keeping their children at home, they are helping us to keep people safe, and reducing pressure on our education system, and on our NHS. Be in no doubt, we are facing many challenges because of this pandemic. My primary concern is, and always will be, the health and well-being of our children, of our young people, and of all the staff in our education settings. And I am very grateful to everyone who is supporting us in these endeavours. Thank you very much\u2014diolch yn fawr. And I'm now happy to answer questions that members of the committee may have this afternoon."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you very much, Minister. I'm sure that the committee echoes the heartfelt thanks you have just given then. The first questions we've got this afternoon are from Hefin David."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Good afternoon, Minister. With regard to your five principles, which you've set out today, regarding when schools will reopen, they're very clear that they require a judgment from you. So could you outline when you think that schools might reopen?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Thank you, Hefin. I am very clear that schools will move to a new phase\u2014because, already, schools are open in many settings; we will move to a new phase when it is safe to do so and when I have advice from the chief medical officer and the chief scientific officer that it is safe to do so.\u00a0I have made very clear in my statement that that is not imminent. I know that in some cases there has been speculation that a return to normal could be with us quite shortly. I'm clear that a return to normal is not imminent, and therefore I'm not in a position to give a date as to when we will see more schools opening up to more children."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Have you been given any indication at all by the chief medical officer as to when, in the longer term, it might be?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No, I have not been given a date. What I have done today is publish the principles that will aid me in, as you said, me making a decision. So, clearly, we will be relying on the advice of our medical and scientific advisers, but the principles are very clear. Firstly, we will need to consider any decision to have more children returning to school in the context of the safety and the physical and the emotional well-being of children and young people and the staff. Obviously, I can't make a decision regarding education in isolation. It will have to be taken in the context of the wider Welsh Government response to dealing with this pandemic. Thirdly, it is absolutely crucial in making any decisions that we have clearly communicated that to parents and to staff, on the information that we have used to reach any decisions, to build confidence for parents and professionals, but also to give them time to plan. It will be impossible to move quickly to new ways of working. And we also have to look at\u2014and it's been paraphrased quite a lot today\u2014if we are looking at certain groups of children accessing more education within a school setting, which groups they should be. And, finally, how do we operationalise that? How do we make those settings as safe as they possibly can be, and how do we tackle some of the difficult challenges of everything from ensuring that we have adequate numbers of workforce available, to the very real questions about how you would do social distancing in the context of education, school transport issues, how you would avoid people gathering at the school gate, for instance? So, there are very practical issues that would need to be considered and thought through very, very carefully before we could return, before what we could see is a move from where we are now to the next phase of education, and new approaches to what schooling may look like. But, again, I must be absolutely clear to you, members of the committee, and to people watching: it is not feasible, in this sense, that we would move from where we are now to what all of us would regard as normal education and what the operation of schools looked like before the start of this pandemic."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, what is clear from what you've said is that it's going to be phased return. I would assume that would be the most vulnerable\u2014perhaps additional learning needs pupils would return first. Just reading some of the things that you've said today, can you answer that question? And can I also ask: you said that guiding principle No. 3 will be having the confidence of parents, staff and students, based on evidence and information, so they can plan ahead. What will that evidence and information be, and how will you know that you've got the confidence of parents to return?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, as I said, primarily, we will need to take a lead from our scientific and medical advisers. I want to also say that we are obviously working on a four-nation basis and keeping in very close contact with my counterparts in Northern Ireland, Scotland and England. But we're also looking beyond the United Kingdom to approaches to education in the face of this pandemic. Members are aware that we as a nation are a member of the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory. So, recently I was able to talk to educationalists and Ministers in Iceland, other parts of Europe, North America, South America and Australia. So, we're also looking at best international evidence in this regard. And, clearly, we will need to be very clear, as today is an attempt to be very clear with parents and our teaching professionals, and the unions that represent them, about the basis of that evidence."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And could I just ask, with regard to the principles, do they then apply to further education and universities?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, of course, when we are discussing these challenges, we are doing that with our colleagues in both the school sector but also our colleagues in the FE sector, and we're in close contact with colleagues in higher education to share thinking on these matters."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But these principles don't apply in those circumstances; these are principles for schools only."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "These principles are applying to both, and our work in this area is applying to both schools and FE colleges. Clearly, universities, as independent institutions, we wouldn't be able to dictate to. But I want to be absolutely clear: we are working with representatives of the HE sector to include them in this work. And I have received, not assurances, but from discussions that I've had with Universities Wales and vice-chancellors, they are very keen to be kept apprised of these approaches, because they may well wish to implement something similar within their own institutions."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. I've got a couple of supplementaries now; firstly, from Suzy Davies, and then I'm going to go to Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. Suzy. No, we can't hear Suzy. Suzy? No. I'll go to Si\u00e2n, then, and then I'll come back to Suzy. Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Chair, I don't think my microphone is muted."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. I'll move on to my question to Kirsty Williams. Now, it is clear that any decisions that need to be taken on reopening schools would have to be made in the context of all of the other issues that the Welsh Government has to take into account. And it is entirely clear that the approach of Government towards testing hasn't been sufficiently developed for us to even start to think about removing restrictions. So, wouldn't it be dangerous, if truth be told, to start to discuss reopening schools when we haven't had the necessary testing in place for the majority of the population? And doesn't it convey a mixed message that we're starting to relax some of these restrictions when, in reality, the restrictions are still in place and still need to be in place robustly?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "First of all, thank you very much, Si\u00e2n, for that important question. Can I be absolutely clear, and I thought I had been pretty clear in answering Hefin David, that we are not relaxing any of the restrictions with regard to education? As I said to Hefin, it is not imminent that we would see a further phase in the next stage of education here in Wales. What I have done today is to provide clarity on the nature of the principles that I would use when coming to any discussion. It is the responsibility of me, as the Minister, and indeed of the wider Government, to begin to think about planning for the future. But I have been absolutely clear: we are not moving to an imminent change in how education is operating at the moment. And I'm also very, very clear that should we be given the opportunity to see more children in our schools, I will only do that when it is safe for me to do so, when I've been advised by the CMO that I am able to do that, and we have given sufficient time and planning to the sector to respond. It is not going to be easy, and we will need to give them, as a sector, time to be able to address. But if I have not been clear enough, let me say it again: we are not relaxing any issues around schools at present, nor is that imminent."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Suzy, I think we can try going to you again now."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you. Minister, in your consideration of introducing a phased return to school, in due course, have you taken into consideration how things like school absences are going to be managed? Because, regardless of the amount of good work you do on messaging, there will still be some families that don't realise that going back to school is for their particular family. Will there be a relaxation of, effectively, what we would call truancy rules? Or is that something that schools will be getting guidance on much up-front?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Thank you, Suzy. As I said in my statement earlier today, returning to school will not be a return to normal, and in recognition of this, I've already made it clear that I will seek, in all opportunities, to reduce the burdens on school. That includes various data collection, the suspension of performance measures and removing the requirement to undertake literacy and numeracy testing, and, clearly, school attendance will want to be an important factor of that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. I'm keen to go on now to talk about the current situation as being faced by our children and young people in schools with some questions from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Since yesterday, the Welsh Government has started publishing data on the number of schools that are open, the number of children attending those schools, and the number of staff involved, and they have been making this information available as per capita of the population. On average, I think it's 1 per cent of the children of Wales that actually attend these locations, and some 5 per cent of the staff. So, can you analyse those figures a little further? Can you tell us how many children, according to this data, are children of key workers, and how many are vulnerable children?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Thank you very much, Si\u00e2n. As you quite rightly say, on average, we have 518 school hubs open each day, with up to 4,200 children attending. We have seen an increase in the number of attendances since the start of what would have been the traditional summer term. We have approximately 5.6 per cent of the teaching population working in those hubs, and at present, 85 per cent of the children who are attending are the children of key workers, the remainder being vulnerable children. So, we are now averaging 600 vulnerable children per day. These are small numbers, but we have seen an increase in those numbers since the start of what would have been the traditional summer term."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. I'm sure we'll return to that point a little later on. How much confidence do you therefore have that the arrangements are effective in terms of the safety of staff and children at these locations?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Thank you once again for that. The smooth operation of the hubs, with regard to health and safety, is, of course, of paramount importance. What we have seen since schools closed for traditional statutory purposes and moving to their repurposed function\u2014we have seen a change of pattern over time. So, following my announcement on, I believe, 18 March, the week after, we saw a large number of settings open and operating. As local authorities have been able to understand the demand for those places\u2014from critical workers and vulnerable children\u2014we have seen more local authorities move to a hub model, and we have been able to publish guidance to local authorities on how issues around safe working in those hubs should be followed, and we've been able to give guidance in that regard. Local authorities are asked by us to report any incidents where they are concerned about operation issues on the ground."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "As I mentioned earlier, testing is crucially important in dealing with this crisis. So, how many school staff have been tested for COVID because they may have experienced symptoms and so on? And how many of those have tested positive?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "My understanding from Public Health Wales is that 15 teachers have been tested for COVID-19, and I believe two of those results have come back as positive. Can I make it absolutely clear, the week before last, Welsh Government issued new guidance around who should be tested? I want to make it absolutely clear to those professionals working in our hubs, if they or a member of their family are exhibiting any of the symptoms, however mild, of COVID-19, they can and they should be tested."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. And the final question from me on this: how important is testing going to be in this next phase, as you start to think about relaxing restrictions?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Obviously, the ability to be able to test, to trace and to quarantine will be critical to the next phase and will be a very, very important and significant building block in all aspects of the Government's work to respond to this pandemic."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you, Minister, and thank you, Si\u00e2n. We've got some questions now on the impact on particular groups of children, from Dawn Bowden."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. Just following on from your answer to Si\u00e2n Gwenllian earlier about the number of vulnerable children in school, what's being done specifically to facilitate more of those children coming into a school setting or hub at the moment? I'm thinking about the 600 you've talked about, and I know, in one of my local authority areas of Merthyr, which is a very small authority, we're talking about the number of children identified as vulnerable running into thousands, not hundreds, and that's just in one authority. So, this is a particularly difficult issue to address, I appreciate, but how are we going to get more of these children into the hubs?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay, Dawn. The first thing to say is that the issue of vulnerable children attending settings is one that is a challenge to not just Wales, but also to my colleagues in Northern Ireland, Scotland and England. I'm pleased to say that we are working across Government departments\u2014myself, obviously, and colleagues in education\u2014with colleagues in social services to have a cross-Government approach to these issues. I think the first thing to say is that these are complex messages, because the overriding public health message from our Government has been to stay at home and children should be kept at home as much as possible, and to make sure that our hubs run smoothly, safely and effectively, we do need to limit the number of children who are attending those hubs. So, firstly, the fact that numbers are small is in some ways a success of our public health messages, because parents have been heeding those messages, but, of course, all of us will have concerns for some children who remain at home. So, I'm pleased to say that we have seen a doubling in the last week of the number of children. So, although numbers are small, they have doubled over the course of the last week. We're working with local authorities and they have assured us that children and young people with a social worker have been risk assessed on a multi-agency basis and are receiving support in a number of ways, and that includes having conversations about some of those children attending the hubs. They're also looking to support in other ways. Of course, some of our children who would be classed as vulnerable\u2014and our definition of 'vulnerable' is one that is shared between the systems in England and Wales\u2014could be children with a statement of special educational needs. For some of those children who, perhaps, have very intense health needs, actually, staying at home is the appropriate thing for that child and that family to do, and we're looking to support families, and local authorities and local education systems are looking to support families, in a number of ways. We also know that just because you don't have a social worker or a statement of special educational needs does not mean that a child may not be vulnerable, and schools are very aware of the needs of those children and have been carrying out regular telephone check-ins where they can\u2014if the age of the child is appropriate\u2014just to keep in touch with those families and those individual children. But we will continue to work across Government to encourage, where it is appropriate, children to attend settings, and, if it is not appropriate for children to be in a setting, that there is contact with those children and young people to ensure that they remain, and their families remain, supported."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Minister. It's encouraging to hear you talk about the ongoing safeguarding of children that are at home and I assume, within that, appropriate referral mechanisms are still in place if teachers or anybody has any particular concern about a child. Similarly, with special educational needs, whereas some of those children benefit clearly from a one-to-one provision in a school, and they may not respond as well to remote working, or remote contact, with an SEN advisor, are you considering in any way any relaxation of the lockdown rule in particular for those children in terms of them being able to access the support that they need for their particular educational needs?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, first of all, Dawn, you're absolutely right: my expectation is that schools should remain in contact with children and continue to identify vulnerable children, and schools should continue to refer children to children's services if they have any concerns, and that would also, of course, be the case for youth workers who may be keeping in contact with children. So, there is a professional expectation on all those that are working with our children and young people that, despite the circumstances they find themselves in, they should continue to report and refer cases if they see anything or hear or are told anything that makes them concerned about a child's welfare and safety. With regard to children with additional learning needs, I am aware that that can present a number of challenges to families and children, and perhaps Steve Davies could give some further details. We have been keen to work with local authorities to ensure specialist provision, where that is appropriate\u2014so, if I could give you an example of my own local authority in Powys, they have two specialist centres available for children with more profound additional learning needs, and those centres are available\u2014recognising, however, that, even with the provision of specialist hubs, it can be a challenge for some children with additional learning needs to find themselves outside of a routine. Hubs are often staffed on a rota basis and therefore children could be faced with staff that they are unfamiliar with. So, even when local authorities\u2014and the vast, vast majority of them do\u2014have specialist services in place, sometimes that might not be the best thing for a child's health and well-being. But perhaps Steve can give us further details of the conversations that have been taking place with directors of education to ensure that children with additional learning needs have access to the hubs and specialist support. Steve."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "Yes, myself and colleague Albert Heaney\u2014colleague-director\u2014have been in regular touch with directors of education and directors of social services to make sure that these children and young people's needs are catered for. We are very aware of all of the special schools\u2014profound and multiple learning difficulties, EBD schools and pupil referral units\u2014that have been kept open in their own way, but also, in some cases, as hubs, to deliver those services for those children's needs, and we're pleased that the directors and the local authorities have responded so constructively. So, we have the details of every school that's open, the pupils who are attending, and we are clear that the risk assessments that the Minister referred to for children with special needs, as well as wider vulnerable groups\u2014they are having risk assessments to make sure that, where there is a need identified for a pupil that is not currently attending a hub, then the local authority can be working with that child and with the parents."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you, Steve. Dawn."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you. Just two more questions. One is around emotional and mental health difficulties being experienced by children and young people at the moment. Now, there was a very welcome announcement of \u00a31.25 million pounds for school counselling. How is that, in practical terms, being applied if those children are not actually in school?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "You're right, Dawn: we have to consider how we can support children not only in their learning during this time, but also to recognise the very real impact that the pandemic will have on all of our mental health and well-being\u2014recognising, of course, it is absolutely natural for all of us, including children and young people, to have fears and anxieties at this time. That's a natural reaction to the situation that we find ourselves in. But, of course, there are issues around those children that would have currently been receiving school counselling, and also being able to be in a position to respond to a potential growth in the number of children that are receiving support. So, the additional money will be made available to local authorities to be able to increase and ramp up services to support children and families. In the immediacy, of course, that will have to be done in different ways than perhaps we've traditionally delivered services in the past, because of social distancing and lockdown rules, but we want to get some of these systems in place now, rather than waiting for everything to go back to normal. We need to be able to plan to offer services in the here and now, but also be able to plan for what potentially could be an increase in the demand of those services. So, we've been in close touch with local authorities, asking them what they believe that they will need and how they can use additional financial resources, and we've been very pleased to be able to secure that for them."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "So, that would include things like telephone and video support as well, I guess, then."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, absolutely. So, that would include remote counselling as in a fashion that we're doing now, but also, as and when some of the restrictions are perhaps removed, looking at an enhanced family therapy, or a therapy approach. So, when we talk about counselling, I think it's important to recognise that there will be some flexibility around this money and it does not necessarily mean that local authorities have to use it on a one-to-one basis. That might not be appropriate for some children, especially our younger children and their families, and they can use that money to provide counselling or therapy\u2014in the widest possible terms\u2014that is the best method to support individual children and their families. But, clearly, we're having to do that in the confines of lockdown and social distancing at the moment. Some of that money can also be used to support the professional learning and the professional development of counsellors, because, of course, they may be being asked to work in a different way and we need to make sure that they have the appropriate skills and abilities to do that."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you. Thank you, Minister."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Dawn, before you ask your final question, I've got a couple of supplementaries\u2014firstly from Suzy, and then from Hefin."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Oh, thank you. My question goes back to the comment you made earlier, Minister, about the number of children doubling\u2014sorry, vulnerable children doubling\u2014after the Easter break, if we can call it that. So, what I'm after is a sense of churn in these establishments. So, was that figure a recovery of a number of children that had been there before the Easter break, and are the people who are there still the same people as were there right at the beginning of the crisis and the lockdown?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Suzy, what I believe that we're seeing in our schools is new pupils coming into school. So, there has been, I know, a real effort on behalf of educationalists and social services staff to really reach out to families and to make sure that they're aware of the support that is available out there for them and their children, and to be able to give them the confidence that there are\u2014that the hubs are available for them. So, we have seen an increase in children. Those numbers are still small and, I believe, potentially, there is an opportunity to build on that and to have further conversations with families about the support that is available for vulnerable children, whether that\u2014. That vulnerability, of course, can cover a whole range of issues. As I said when we last met, this is a constantly evolving situation. The initial response\u2014local authorities and schools worked incredibly fast and incredibly quickly to set up these hubs. We've seen an evolution in the weeks since that time and I am sure that we will continue to see some evolution in approaches."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Hefin, you had a supplementary\u2014briefly, please."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Yes, very quickly. I've been listening to the answers with regard to vulnerable children, following on from that answer. I'm at home with a vulnerable child\u2014a child who has got additional learning needs. She's got autism; she's four. I imagine there are many, many parents in exactly the same position\u2014I've heard from them. I haven't heard anything from the school or from the local authority. Should I have heard something or should I be proactive in pursuing it?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I don't want to comment on personal cases\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But there are many others in this position."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "\u2014but what I would say is that if parents have concerns and want to have a conversation about what support is available to them and their children, they should contact their local education authority to have a conversation as to what support is available."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Dawn, final question, please."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Yes, my last question is really about the potential for the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their more affluent peers. Is that a concern for you? I'm thinking particularly in relation to those less affluent families in having access to technology and so on. What kind of concerns do you have about that and what are we looking to do to try to ensure that that doesn't actually play out?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Thank you, Dawn. All of the statistics would tell us that learning loss and the gap, potentially, will affect those more vulnerable children the most. Clearly, we will want to consider that as we think about what the new normal for education may look like, or as we develop into future phases. Depending on where that child is in their educational journey, of course, the needs and the potential for loss are slightly different. So, for instance, when we're thinking about very young children, we could be thinking about a lack of social interaction and the development of oracy skills. Of course, that, potentially, then will have a knock-on to their ability to learn to read and then to write, for instance. For other children who are, perhaps, older and heading towards formal examinations, the challenge when they return to school will be a slightly different one. I'm not sure, Chair, whether you want me to give some further details about our continuity-of-learning plan and how we are looking to address digital disadvantage now, or whether there are questions later."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Well, I've got a question on that coming up, so, if it's okay, Dawn, we'll go on to that now. Before we do that, I was just going to ask how the Welsh Government is paying due regard to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and, obviously, the right children and young people have to an education. I was going to ask you about the risk of inequality due to varying access to digital resources, which are so important in ensuring continuity of learning."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "You're absolutely correct, Chair. Officials are very aware of our responsibilities towards children's rights in this regard and we are doing whatever we can to ensure that children have an equal opportunity and have equal access to learning at this time. We are fortunate in the regard that, because of previous decisions and investments, we have a strong base on which to build because we have our Hwb digital learning platform and because we have invested heavily in the national purchasing of Microsoft Office and Google for Education tools, which are available to all families. We have become the first, I think\u2014we're certainly the first in the UK, and I'm not sure whether we're the first across the world, but I think we probably are\u2014to deploy, for instance, Adobe Spark nationally. But, obviously, access to hardware and connectivity is crucial at this time. Officials are working with local authorities to ensure that all children have access to both the hardware and the connectivity they need to be able to participate in digital learning at this particular time."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Just a final question from me: how exactly are we communicating to parents what the expectations are of them in terms of delivering this education at home now? Are there, for example, guidelines on recommended hours of home learning per day of the week or volume of work to be completed? How are we ensuring that parents know how best to lead their children through this at the moment?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Firstly, can I recognise what a challenge this is? We've just heard from Hefin who is carrying on his day job as the Assembly Member, but is obviously trying to do that as well as care for and provide learning for his children, and I know, Chair, that you're doing the same, and I'm certainly trying to do the same, and it's a real challenge, it's not easy. As part of our 'Stay Safe. Stay Learning' policy statement, advice is available to parents and carers on the Hwb platform as to what they best can do to support their children. I think the really important message that I've been trying to give to parents is not to be too hard on ourselves. I know that everybody is doing the best that they can in really challenging circumstances. And if they have concerns, they should be in contact with their child's school, but we do have specific advice and guidance to parents on the Hwb platform."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. We're going to move on now to some questions on examinations from Janet Finch-Saunders. Janet, we can't hear you. I tell you what, we'll\u2014. Janet, do you want to try again? No. Okay, we'll go on then to questions on higher education and post 16, and we'll come back to examinations, if that's okay. Suzy."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, thank you, Chair. Before we leave continuity of learning, do you mind if I just ask this one question?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "No, that's fine. Yes, go on."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Your comment, Minister, on working with local authorities to make sure that individuals have hardware: can you just give us a bit of detail on what working with local authorities actually means? In the process of that, is there any data gathering going on for those pupils who are being educated at home and the levels at which they're engaging? You know, are they sticking with it, or how many are dropping out? Because I think the two of those perhaps go together."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, absolutely. So, I'm hoping to make an announcement tomorrow, if not later on this week, about some specific details around support for hardware and connectivity. We're working closely with local authorities to understand just that: to understand from the schools the number of schools that\u2014and a number of them have already done this\u2014have been lending Chromebooks, iPads and laptops to children, and also identifying children who are not perhaps engaging in the activities that have been made available. And we'll be doing two things to support local authorities. The first is to use the stock of equipment that they already have to be able to provide hardware to students. So, we have purchased on a national basis software that, when applied to an old piece of kit, essentially turns it into an out-of-the-box Chromebook. Because, as you can imagine, just like other things during a pandemic, there has been a rush to buy new stuff on the market and then there is a scramble and nobody can get what they need. So, we're utilisng kit that is already available in schools and local authorities, and we will look to backfill that to schools at a later point out of our EdTech investment programme. The other issue is, once a child has a Chromebook or a laptop or a device, issues around connectivity. So, we're also looking to purchase on a national level and distribute Mi-Fi connectivity, so students will be able to have access to Wi-Fi where they don't have that already. That's why we need to work closely with local authorities and schools to identify the level of that need and to make sure the stuff gets to the right children. One of the ways in which we are able to do that is to look at engagement in education. So, if a child hasn't been engaging, is that because they just don't want to and they're voting with their feet\u2014but clearly teachers need to have a conversation about that\u2014or is that because the child simply does not have the ability to do that, and therefore we need to get that stuff out to those children? So, rather than just simply leaving it to local authorities to scramble around in a very crowded market to get the stuff that they will need, we're trying to do that on a national basis and deploy that to local authorities. So, our officials have been having conversations with each of our local authorities to ascertain what's already happened, and there is very good practice out there\u2014schools have been proactive\u2014but where there are gaps, what can we do as a national Government to be able to assist them to do that? We are repurposing some of the resources that we had previously identified for our EdTech investment, using those resources to fill this particular gap."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. We're going to go back to Janet now. I believe we've got sound again, so Janet can ask her questions on examinations. Janet."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. I thought it was something at this end; I'm glad to hear it wasn't. When will vocational learners know what is happening with their assessments, and how will those who have no choice but to wait for a vocational assessment be supported?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. That's a very good question, Janet, because I know that there has been some concern and anxiety around vocational qualification students and how quickly we've been able to provide certainty for them. You'll be aware that Qualifications Wales have been able, in the last week, to be able to give that greater clarity. So, they have announced that learners due to complete their Essential Skills Wales qualifications will receive results. They have also published their approach to how health and social care qualifications will be managed, because, of course, those are part of the first set of reformed quals that we have done on a Wales basis. You are right, there are a group of students who fall into the category where there are technical qualifications that require a certificate of competency to be industry ready\u2014I hope I've explained that correctly\u2014and, therefore, we are working to understand how we can accommodate those students in these particular circumstances. But, at this stage, there may be some delay for that element of their qualification being delayed to a further date."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Janet."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Yes. What are your expectations for how A-level and GCSE qualifications will be awarded this summer, following the ministerial direction that you have issued to Qualifications Wales? For example, how is an appropriate balance being taken between recognising the progress of pupils in their coursework, mock examinations, and other work to date, and also, the potential of pupils who might have performed particularly well in their examinations this summer?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, Janet, I understand\u2014and today is a day where some students would have been undertaking practical examinations\u2014I understand how devastating it has been to both students and teachers alike for the decision I had to take to cancel this summer's exam series. But I'm absolutely clear that was the only decision that could have been reached. Qualifications Wales has made it very clear\u2014and for people who would like more information, I would urge them to look at Qualifications Wales's website\u2014how they will go about giving, allocating, and awarding a grade to our A-level and GCSE students. Firstly, teachers will be asked to submit a grade they believe that student would have obtained, should they have taken an exam. And, of course, teachers will have a range of data and their own professional judgment that they will use in awarding that grade. Teachers will also be asked to rank students in order. Once that information has been submitted to Qualifications Wales, there will be a process by which that data will be moderated; moderated from centre to centre and across the nation, thus giving us the chance to award a student a fair grade whilst being, and remaining, true to ensuring that we have a robust qualifications system, and allowing those students who find themselves at a critical stage of their education, where they are looking to move on to the next stages\u2014that they will have the grades that will allow them to make decisions about their future."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you, Janet. We're going to go on now, then, to the questions on higher and further education from Suzy Davies. Suzy."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. I suppose my first question just goes back to the 16-year-olds at the moment and those who are looking forward to either going to college, the older ones going to university, there'll be apprenticeships, all kinds of future pathways for post 16. What's happening at school level, or even at college level, to get those students ready for the next steps, because, obviously, they're not in their usual environments and getting their usual programme of teaching?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No, that's quite right, Suzy, and I should have said in answer to Janet's question, as well\u2014I'm sure people already know, but just to get the point across\u2014that A-level results day and GCSE day will run as normal across not just Wales, but England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which is really important. You're right, Suzy\u2014for those people that are coming to the end of one part of their education this is a particularly challenging time. You'll be aware that, last week, on Hwb, we were able to launch a programme for year 13 students to help them get ready for university. I'm very grateful to the HE sector in Wales, who've worked really hard with us on that. So, for instance, if you were a year 13 student or even a year 12 student that was thinking about or interested in areas around social policy, you could have tuned into a social policy lecturer at Swansea University. If you go to the Hwb website, you will be able to see that there are subject listings, everything from animal science through to law, politics, history and science, with links through to higher education and further education courses that students can avail themselves of. There's also a section on preparation for essential study skills, whether that is report writing or academic writing. So, there is a range of activities and courses available for year 13, so that children\u2014'children'; they're all children to me\u2014young people can get themselves\u2014. They don't have to stop learning, and they can get themselves ready for the next stage of their education. Again, for those children, perhaps, who are coming to the end of their GCSEs, there is a range of information, either within their own schools or within their local colleges about things that can keep them learning. So, for instance, I'm aware of one school where you can go onto the website and there are recommendations of, for instance, what you could be reading over the summer if you're interested in doing this particular A-level in September. I know that there are also moves in schools and in colleges to be able to make sure that those children don't miss out on really important careers advice at this time, as well, and information, so they can make informed decisions. I know that people are working hard to link up children to advice services that are available so that they can make those really important future decisions with the advice of either a teacher or other professional so that they've got those options. So, there is material out there and it's growing all the time. This week, we were able to launch our virtual Seren network. You'll be aware that, for the last couple of years, we've been able to send Welsh children to the Yale global summer school. Clearly, that can't happen this year. That's devastating for those year 12s who had worked so hard and had won a place on that programme. They will now be able to attend the Yale global scholars programme virtually and remotely, because Yale have moved that programme online. So, we're developing materials and resources all of the time."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you for that answer. Before I move on to my next question, can you give me some sort of sense of how that Hwb\u00a0domain is being populated? Where is all this information being sourced from?

Can I just say that, last week, we were looking at, every day, in the region of well over 150,000 logins a day into Hwb?"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, that's great. So there's proactive populating of Hwb. That's what I was after. That's great. Just going back to some of Janet's questions and the assessed grades, I want to talk to you about the unconditional offers and where we are with that at the moment for entry to universities, because there's going to be a scramble now of the available students for further education, but primarily higher education institutions, across the UK. Is the moratorium on unconditional offers still standing? Are there conversations going on to extend that moratorium? Otherwise, this scramble is going to potentially negatively affect our universities quite considerably."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, you'll be aware that a moratorium does exist. It exists in this current context to 1 May. We continue to keep in close touch with colleagues in Northern Ireland, Scotland and in the Westminster Government around these issues. Officials are also in touch with UCAS, and in the last couple of days I've had at least three meetings with representatives of the Welsh higher education sector to discuss these matters."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I just want to ask you now about students and their maintenance loan grants. I think they're getting, around now, the money going into their bank account that they would normally have expected at this time of year. That's right, yes?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "That's correct, yes."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "What's happening to those students who would normally be living in digs somewhere but are now living at home? Are they likely to be asked to reimburse part of the cost, because obviously it's not as expensive to live at home as away, and what's likely to be happening with the maintenance loans over the summer holiday period, potentially? Because we've had a period now where students can't top up their maintenance loans by going out and working on weekends or working in the evenings, or whatever, so their income has been impacted. Just in the round, what kind of conversations are happening around that? Again, it's probably a four-nation approach, I would imagine."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Thank you, Suzy. You are correct to say that our student support regime does allow for a lower payment to be made to those students that stay at home during their studies, but I want to reassure students that there will be no change to their student support payments just because they have left their universities and have decided to go home. There should be no change. Also, we are continuing, it should be important to say, to pay education maintenance allowance at this time for our FE students that are eligible for that, even though, obviously, for EMA there is an attendance requirement, but clearly that is not appropriate to enforce at the moment. You are correct\u2014this is a worrying time for many students in higher education, especially for those who are looking to graduate at this time and are going out into an economy that has been tremendously badly hit by the pandemic. At this time, we continue to have conversations with NUS Wales about what can be done within a Welsh context, but, as you quite rightly say, also within a UK context, to support students who may have been affected. We are continuing\u2014on our webpage we have a frequently asked questions section that advises students in the first instance, especially when it comes, for instance, to the cost of accommodation\u2014to have those discussions, and I'm very grateful that, in some cases, some of our institutions have been able to waive or partially waive accommodation fees where students have vacated their accommodation and have returned to their usual home address. But we will continue to have dialogue with NUS Wales and with our counterparts across the country to look to see what more we can do to support students at this time."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you for that answer, and, yes, I was pleased to see that announcement through the NUS as well, so well done to those accommodation providers who have a heart. I think we'll all have seen the Universities UK document that explains some of the difficulties that they're going to be running into if this proceeds much further. My understanding is that the main emphasis at the moment is to try and get all the universities across the UK through this initial period of difficulty by releasing as much money as possible. I can see that your figure to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales was a little bit down on last year's letter\u2014not that there's been a remit letter yet, but an indication. Are you releasing that money earlier so that they can use it more swiftly, or does that not matter?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Before you come in, Minister, that is going to have to be the last question, just to make you aware of that, because we are coming up to the end of our time."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. That's fine."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Of course, Suzy, we are working closely with Universities Wales and have a lot of sympathy for the proposals that have come forward from Universities UK, which Wales's universities have been a part of forming. Stability in the first instance is really important to us, which is why we've been able to give an indication to HEFCW about resources that are available, and we've been very clear to HEFCW that we want to be as flexible as possible in how they use those resources to support institutions. That potentially would mean reprofiling the way in which money gets out to institutions, but clearly we will need to have an ongoing discussion about how we respond to the immediacy of the issues facing HE, how we can get stability for the next academic year, and how we then can support the sector through what is a really challenging time for them. We will do that in a Welsh context and we will continue to do that also in a UK context, because you will have seen the scale of some of the figures that have been talked about in terms of the impact on the HE sector at this time. Clearly, a four-nation approach to that will be crucial."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you.

A reminder to all members that in order to avoid issues with sound, members participating in person should not also be connected to the video conference.

As usual, please direct your remarks through the chair. I understand we don't have any ministerial announcements today, so we'll proceed to presenting petitions. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions.

I'm here to present two petitions containing hundreds of signatures on the issue of the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners by the People's Republic of China, particularly the practice that's alleged of involuntary organ harvesting. The petitioners ask the Government of Canada to condemn this practice and to publicly call for an end to the persecution of Falun Gong in the People's Republic of China. The second petition is from residents throughout SaanichGulf Islands concerned about what was, at the time this petition was submitted, a future problem. It remains an issue, and I present it on behalf of petitioners who wish the Government of Canada not to put public funds into purchasing or maintaining the Trans Mountain pipeline or towards any expansion of the pipeline."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Next we'll go to Ms. Kwan."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Jenny Kwan (Vancouver East, NDP)", "content": "Mr. Chair, I rise to table two petitions. The first petition deals with the COVID-19 situation. The petitioners note the pandemic is having a devastating impact on many Canadians nationwide, especially those who have low to modest income, small business gig workers, freelancers, artists, film industry workers, non-salaried workers and individuals on fixed incomes such as seniors and those on disability. It further notes that rent, mortgage and utility payments are due at the end of each month, putting countless Canadians at risk of losing their housing. It is paramount there be safe self-isolation opportunities for all individuals in this country. To that end, the petitioners are calling for the government to immediately enact a nationwide rent freeze, eviction freeze, mortgage freeze and utility freeze, enforce mortgage deferrals for homeowners without penalty or interest charges from financial institutions and provide direct assistance in the form of a monthly, universal, direct payment of $2,000 per month for all, with an additional $250 per child immediately. The second petition deals with the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. These petitioners join the hundreds of thousands of people who are opposed to the expansion. Trans Mountain, in building the pipeline, brings massive environmental and economic risk with no substantial benefit to British Columbia or to local residents. Approximately 40,000 barrels of oil have already leaked from existing Kinder Morgan pipelines, including two major spills in Burnaby since 2007. I might note, Mr. Chair, that just this past weekend there was yet another spill to the tune of 1,195 barrels here in British Columbia. There is no known scientific technology to clean up the bitumen when there is a spill, and the number of tankers would go from eight to 34 per month into the Burrard Inlet. It puts at risk many residential neighbourhoods and the traditional territories of at least 15 first nations."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "May I interrupt for a moment, Ms. Kwan.

The petitioners are calling for the government to immediately act to prevent this new oil pipeline from proceeding through British Columbia."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Thank you. We'll now go to Mr. Genuis."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC)", "content": "Mr. Chair, I have four petitions to present today. The first petition reflects the outrage of my constituents at the ever-expanding order in council from the government banning more and more firearms. In particular, the petitioners highlight the failure of the government to act on the issue of illegal guns. The petitioners note that virtually all violent crimes committed in Canada, including the recent shooting in Nova Scotia, involve illegal firearms in the hands of those who are already not permitted to possess them. The petition has two asks. First of all, it asks that we reverse the order in council banning certain firearms, but also that we propose measures that will effectively address the illegal use of firearms by criminals while respecting the rights of law-abiding citizens. It also asks that we ensure that substantial changes to firearms laws in future actually be made by Parliament, not by the government acting in an unaccountable manner. The second petition deals with Bill C-8, which is the government's bill around conversion therapy. The petitioners support efforts to ban conversion therapy. They express concern about problems in the wording of the definition used in the legislation. They're asking the government to support amendments to fix the definition to address the issue of conversion therapy and ensure that the definition is correct and doesn't criminalize certain forms of counselling that individuals may voluntarily enter into. The third petition is regarding Bill S-204, a bill in the Senate that seeks to make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad to receive an organ without consent, dealing especially with the horrific practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking in China. The petitioners are supportive of Bill S-204 and want to see it move forward. The final petition is with respect to Bill C-7. There's been much discussion in this House about the need to do better in terms of long-term care. Rather than working to do better in long-term care, unfortunately we've seen the government removing vital safeguards in the area of euthanasia. I think our focus should be on assisting life rather than removing safeguards that are required in association with the euthanasia regime. The petitioners are particularly concerned about the government's plan to remove a 10-day reflection period that normally takes place. That period can already be waived under certain circumstances, but Bill C-7 proposes to remove it entirely as well as reduce the number of witnesses involved. The petitioners are quite concerned about what's going on in Bill C-7 and call for it to be stopped or amended."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Presenting petitions.

Recent events have ripped open the wound of systemic racism in our country. Racialized and marginalized communities have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic. Thousands of seniors in long-term care facilities have died. It is clear that we need system change. In the past, governments have bailed out banks and corporations because they were too big to fail. It is time to bail out humanity and the planet. No one will be immune from the threat of climate change and mass extinction. Both are the result of the exploitation of the natural world in the name of the economy. Humans created the economy. We can choose to change it. We must protect our environment or perish. COVID-19 has demonstrated that together we can take courageous action for the common good. We need to do the same for the climate crisis, because humanity and our planet are too big to fail."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We'll now go to Mr. Spengemann."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Sven Spengemann (MississaugaLakeshore, Lib.)", "content": "Mr. Speaker, today marks World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. Underestimated and under-reported, elder abuse exists across the world. At risk of neglect and assault, many of the most vulnerable older persons reside in our long-term care facilities. They are the seniors who have built our country and shaped our communities, who have shown us resilience, courage and selflessness, who have made us stronger, and whose work and teachings continue to inspire us. They are parents and grandparents, brothers and sisters, friends and mentors. We have not been there for them in the same way they've been there for us throughout their lives. The Canadian Forces report, alongside the climbing disproportionate death toll in our long-term care facilities, has reconfirmed the ugly, indefensible reality of elder abuse and neglect in Canada. In my community, we mourn the deaths of 68 seniors from one long-term care facility alone, Camilla Care. We must make the same unwavering commitment to older persons as they have shown to us. We must protect and uphold their human rights. We must do better."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Before proceeding, I just want to bring up to the members in the background that we want to keep it as simple and as parliamentary as possible in keeping it neutral. We'll now move to Mr. Barrett."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Michael Barrett (LeedsGrenvilleThousand Islands and Rideau Lakes, CPC)", "content": "During these trying times, the residents of LeedsGrenvilleThousand Islands and Rideau Lakes have risen to the challenge. They've made sacrifices and gone above and beyond to make the lives of their neighbours better and to keep our communities safe. It would be impossible to list everyone who has emerged as a community hero, but I'd like to highlight a few, like Lily, an eight-year-old from Elgin who raised funds for her local food bank by building and selling squirrel picnic tables, and Louise Boardman from Spencerville who's making masks for long-term care facilities and selling others in support of the Breast Cancer Action centre. The Knights of Columbus in Prescott raised funds and are distributing some $27,000 in support of charitable groups throughout the region. The Knights of Columbus in Kemptville are working overtime operating the local food bank. Who can forget our top-notch health care workers like Hannah and Mary at the Brockville COVID-19 testing centre?

The deaths of Chantel Moore and Rodney Levi and the assault on Chief Allan Adam are recent examples of systemic racism within the RCMP. Sadly, the RCMP leadership has failed to acknowledge this reality and its root causes. These same systems negatively impact black Canadians. Anti-black racism has resulted in more young black men being jailed, children being streamed or excluded from schools and negative police interaction due to profiling. Black lives matter. No single Canadian is responsible for the prevalence of systemic racism; we all are. Collectively we build institutions that discriminate based on race. It is now time to reimagine and rework our institutions, starting with our police, to ensure that all Canadians can achieve their truest potential."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Ms.Larouche, you have the floor."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Andranne Larouche (Shefford, BQ)", "content": "Thank you, Mr.Chair. June15 is World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. I want to remind members of the link between abuse and the problems of economic dependency among seniors. Improving their purchasing power means reducing the risk of them falling victim to abusive people. That's why the increase in the old age security benefit and the guaranteed income supplement must be extended beyond the pandemic. In three weeks, our seniors will receive their first cheque, when they should be receiving their second. A date must also be announced for the new horizons for seniors program, which helps several groups develop projects to break the isolation of seniors. In closing, I would like to mention the organization Justice alternative et mdiation that during the pandemic, along with other organizations in Shefford, has set up the project Une histoire pour la tienne, which also serves to mark this day. It's a virtual meeting between young people and seniors, allowing them to exchange some inspiring life experiences. Since age prejudice is very much present, I applaud this project, which aims to make us understand each other better and judge each other less."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We'll now continue with Mr. Sangha."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Ramesh Sangha (Brampton Centre, Lib.)", "content": "Mr. Chair, in the time of this terrible crisis affecting all Canadians, when we are all thinking about how best to deal with it, let's all think about the people around us.

Many small businesses don't qualify for programs. Municipalities need emergency help to meet the crisis. People are worried about what will happen when the CERB runs out in two weeks' time, and the coming tourism season looks very grim. The province itself is in serious financial crisis due to the pandemic and the decline in oil prices. The federal government must overhaul and enhance the fiscal stabilization program to help Newfoundlanders and Labradorians and other oil-producing provinces through this crisis. Both the province and the oil and gas industry players have committed to net zero emissions by 2050. This is a challenge and an opportunity to transition to a sustainable energy future, but it will require significant investment and support by government to keep the industry strong and make this a just transition for workers.

A very important part of this bill was about supporting people with disabilities in this time of crisis. However, the government did not see fit to negotiate with the opposition parties, even though it is in a minority position. Despite this arrogance, the Bloc Qubcois proposed solutions. One of the things we proposed was to split the bill so that we could give this support to people with disabilities, but the Conservatives did not want to do that. We came back and asked for time to negotiate and give support to people with disabilities, but the government defeated the motion.

The government had not thought of it, but they found that it was a good idea. Let me return to the attack. This bill proposed changes to the wage subsidy program, it was supposed to make the CERB more flexible, it proposed fines for fraudsters and, since there was a little section about a benefit for the disabled, the government took it for granted that we would support it without any negotiations with the parties.

These projects are funded through the Canada Nature Fund's target 1 challenge initiative. They'll conserve Canadian nature and biodiversity and protect species at risk, enhance ecological integrity and connectivity, and enhance the size of Canada's vast network of protected areas. Nearly half of these projects are indigenous-led, with the aim of creating indigenous-protected conserved areas.

These measures helped keep our most vulnerable citizens safe and ensured that our hospital and health care providers did not become overwhelmed with a sharp spike in cases. Thanks to our government's COVID-19 emergency response, many of these businesses have been able to keep their employees and access important liquidity through the Canada emergency business account, which provides loans to small businesses and non-profits, and the Canada emergency wage subsidy, which is helping businesses to keep and rehire their employees while their revenues are down by providing up to 75% of wages for up to 24 weeks. As we begin to reopen the economy and Canadians across the country return to the job market, those benefits will be even more important to help businesses and industries rehire their staff and make important adjustments to align with public health guidelines to gradually increase their operations.

This is why we put in place the important programs to help them get through this crisis during this difficult time, programs such as the wage subsidy program. We know that in so many businesses the employees are often like extended family members. The wage subsidy has helped these businesses keep their employees on the payroll and are now helping in their rehiring as they slowly and safely restart. There are 348,000 businesses being helped with the wage subsidy program, and this means that 2.6 million workers are being helped.

It is exactly the step we will take moving forward and that's why we are making those investments to ensure that data exists. We are working across all departments. My mandate letter is public.

My question is simple and goes to the Minister of Finance: where is this money coming from?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Mona Fortier", "content": "MadamChair, I would like to thank my honourable colleague for his question. Currently, the health and safety of Canadians are our top priorities. We have implemented an emergency economic plan to support Canadians, workers and companies. We will continue to support them during this crisis."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Steven Blaney", "content": "The answer I would have liked is simple: we are borrowing the money and we are going to have to pay it back one day. That is another Liberal craze: they borrow money, they make campaign promises, and off they go. Under the Conservative government, the Chantier Davie in Lvis had 1,700workers for the supply ship Asterix. In the election campaign, the Liberals promised icebreakers. When are the Liberals going to award the icebreaker contracts to the Chantier Davie?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. David Lametti (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada)", "content": "MadamChair, we are very proud of the Chantier Davie and we completely understand its role in the system.

Steven Blaney", "content": "The workers do not need words; they need contracts and jobs. The same is true for young people who want to work. There is money in the Canada summer jobs program: in my constituency alone, $150,000has been approved. Companies want young people to work and want to hire them. What is the minister waiting for in order to confirm those positions? In my constituency, and everywhere else in the country, our young people want to work. What is the government waiting for in order to send some cash to the Canada summer jobs program?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Ahmed Hussen", "content": "Madam Chair, we are proud of the Canada summer jobs program. We are introducing flexibilities into the system to enable employers to be able to hire summer students.

We believe in continuing to invest in the Canada summer jobs program."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Steven Blaney", "content": "The workers, the young people and the employers have been waiting for weeks. The money is available; where is the announcement? MadamChair, our young people are not the only ones who want to work. There are also the temporary foreign workers. Let me use Jessie Gito as an example; he has been working at Plate2000 in Saint-Anselme for years. When the time came to renew his work permit, he found out that he has to have some biometric tests. But he cannot get them because the offices are closed. Is the minister going to allow Jessie Gito and the thousands of other temporary foreign workers who want to work to be able to do so until the government biometric testing centres reopen?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Ahmed Hussen", "content": "Madam Chair, it is important for the honourable member to recognize that we are in the early recovery stage of the pandemic. Employers are slowly reopening businesses. We will ensure that we support both our students and our temporary foreign workers to make sure we get the recovery right. We will continue to invest in the Canada summer jobs program. We've introduced flexibilities into the program to ensure that employers are able to take advantage of the program and give opportunities to young people."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Steven Blaney", "content": "It is very simple. Jessie Gito is a foreign worker, who is in a company that provides an essential service. He needs a decision that will let him go to work, rather than staying home and doing nothing. Then, when the government's biometric testing centres are open again, he will gladly go to one. Young people want to work in agriculture as well, and the minister has told us that the government wants young people working and that their files will be processed as quickly as possible. She wants to create 700positions and she knows that people can fill in an application on a first-come first-served basis. Of those 700positions, how many have been confirmed to date?

Over 700 companies have retooled and scaled up their operations for personal protective equipment to help front-line health care workers."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Doug Shipley", "content": "Madam Chair, I need to ask very quickly which ministry and minister are responsible for the sourcing of PPE in Canada."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Navdeep Bains", "content": "Madam Chair, this is a collective effort.

That will make this question all the more pertinent. My riding of BarrieSpringwaterOro-Medonte is the home of Southmedic Inc. Southmedic is a renowned medical supply business. For over 37 years, it has provided front-line health care workers with an extensive line of PPE and other essential products required when dealing with respiratory illnesses. This company specializes in respiratory illness equipment. Southmedic currently employs over 700 people, and it has been recognized as one of Canada's best-managed companies by Deloitte on numerous occasions. Since the beginning of the pandemic, both I and the member for BarrieInnisfil have been attempting to obtain some assistance for Southmedic from the federal government. Calls and emails were falling on deaf ears. In early May, I wrote a letter to Minister Anand outlining the situation. I received a letter back from the minister dated May 27 indicating that this issue of Southmedic falls under the mandate of the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. I have heard nothing more. When will the federal government reach out and help this great Canadian company and therefore ensure that all front-line workers will have the proper PPE they require?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Navdeep Bains", "content": "Madam Chair, I'd like to thank my honourable colleague for his question. He knows full well that this is a very challenging time. That is why we had a call to action to engage Canadians right across the country. Since then, we've seen over 6,000 companies step up to offer solutions and ideas, and over 700 companies have retooled their efforts. I acknowledge that some companies are still engaging with the government, and we'll continue to explore all possible options to make sure we continue to procure the necessary levels of personal protective equipment to protect Canadians and to protect front-line health care workers. That has always been our priority. I want to thank the outstanding Canadian companies that have come forward and have helped us in this endeavour. We continue to look forward to working with them."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Doug Shipley", "content": "Thank you for that answer. Just to follow up, there's no retooling required at this company. They could have been up and going very quickly. They just needed a little assistance at the beginning. Moving on to a different issue, while walking to my office this morning, I stopped at my local small family-run coffee shop and was discussing the current economic situation with the two owners of the establishment. They indicated they are having a very tough time surviving this economic downturn. The only thing keeping them hopeful is that soon the public service will start returning to work, and therefore their business will begin to return. Could the government please give us some indication as to what the plans are for returning the civil service back to work safely, and when?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos (President of the Treasury Board)", "content": "Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm delighted to answer this question. This is a very important topic, but I'd like to take the opportunity first to thank our public servants, who have worked very hard in the last few weeks, both personally and professionally. In fact, today is a wonderful day to say that, because today is the start of National Public Service Week. That's one more reason to thank them for their dedicated work. They are not going to go back to work.

Madam Chair, I have a quick question while we're still talking about Operation LASER. The President of the Treasury Board has said, The Canadian Armed Forces will be present as long as their presence is needed in Quebec. This contradicts what Prime Minister Trudeau is saying, which is that we have a hard deadline of June 26 for the withdrawal of our troops for Operation LASER.

Bill Blair", "content": "Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I'm delighted to have the opportunity to clarify for the House. We've been in very extensive discussions with the Province of Quebec, with my counterpart Minister Guilbault, and we are working very diligently to ensure we have a sustained, appropriate response to the request from Quebec for assistance.

While we know the Broadcasting Act states that the Canadian broadcasting system should reflect the linguistic duality and multicultural and multiracial nature of Canadian society and the special place of indigenous peoples, it would seem there are some challenges. Therefore, does the Minister of Heritage share the concern of some journalists that problems of systemic racism in Canada are still existing within the institution of the CBC, and will the government now acknowledge the need to recognize the jurisdiction of indigenous governments?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Steven Guilbeault (Minister of Canadian Heritage)", "content": "Thank you, Madame Chair; and I thank the member for this important question.

Mostly these are issues addressing inequality and the most marginalized in our society. In the justice system, examples include mandatory minimum penalties, defunding police, and even investing in restorative justice. Red-meat issues often become defining issues for society and for governments as the world changes. Surely now these issues are politically less of a consideration than the tragic reality of even more slain indigenous Canadians at the hands of police, or thousands of indigenous people still incarcerated or living in poverty.

David Lametti", "content": "Madame Chair, I thank the honourable member for her question, as well as for her work as Minister of Justice, and indeed my predecessor. This is an important time. This is a time when we recognize systemic racism. This is a time when we recognize systemic over-incarceration of indigenous peoples, of black peoples, in our criminal justice system. This is a time when we need to look at all potential options to reduce what is a shameful overrepresentation in our criminal justice system.

Many of the deaths are related to COVID-19 measures that have prevented people from accessing supervised consumption sites, so they are overdosing alone.

They've been serving great food for 40 years, but now they're struggling, because they don't qualify for the emergency wage subsidy. Why is that? The original owners retired last year and sold it to another operator. The new owner can't use a year-to-year comparison to apply for the wage subsidy because he didn't own the restaurant last spring. He is forced to use receipts from January and February, the darkest doldrums of the restaurant year, to compare with the results from May, traditionally one of their best months.

To help even more businesses support their workers and rehire people as they reopen, our government is extending the CEWS, and we will continue to extend the CEWS for an additional 12 weeks to August 29 to ensure that Canadian workers continue to have the support they need during these very difficult times. By extending eligibility, our government is ensuring that more Canadian workers in more sectors have the support they need."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Richard Cannings", "content": "The owner just wants to be able to apply for the wage subsidy, and right now he cannot, and he will not be able to.

That is what we are asking. Last week, the leader of the Bloc Qubcois asked the Liberal government to debate BillC-17 today. He did not get an answer. It does not seem to matter. Richard Wagner, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who is hardly a dimwit or greenhorn, told us that the justice system needs to be modernized. As recently as this past Saturday in LaPresse, Justice Wagner said that it is essential that the Criminal Code be amended to address the backlog of court proceedings.

So, item 2, then, today is our first session on the provision of textbooks and learning resources for pupils, which is a video of interviews with young people and teachers. The committee team has been out to take video evidence around Wales, and we're now going to watch the results of that on the screen. Okay. Well, I'm sure that the committee\u00a0would want me to place on record our thanks to the young people and the teachers who took part in that very helpful and informative video. We'll move on now then to our evidence session, and I'm very pleased to welcome Gareth Pierce, chief executive of the WJEC,\u00a0Mike Ebbsworth, assistant director educational support, WJEC,\u00a0Philip Blaker, chief executive of Qualifications Wales, and\u00a0Emyr George, associate director general qualifications\u00a0at Qualifications Wales. So, thank you all of you for attending and thank you for the papers that you provided in advance as well. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions now, and if I can just start by asking you to outline what you see as your role in ensuring that students and teachers in Wales have the resources that they need to pass general qualifications and what you think the role of commercial publishers and Welsh Government is."}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "Shall I start? So, Qualifications Wales is the regulator of the awarding bodies, so we regulate awarding bodies. Our powers are structured around the regulating of awarding bodies. We don't regulate commercial publishers nor the provision of textbooks within that. In regulating the awarding body, our primary focus is also on the design of the qualifications and then the delivery of the assessment. So, it's much more around the assessment side\u00a0than teaching resources. That said, when we are going through the design of the qualifications, we go through an approval process, so we develop approval criteria and we ask WJEC\u00a0to submit their specifications against those approval criteria and sample assessment materials as well. So, our focus is very much on making sure that teachers are able, through the sample assessment materials and the specifications, to have a good understanding of what is going to be expected of them in the examinations and of their pupils in the examinations. So, that's setting out the knowledge, skills and understandings\u00a0that will be assessed by WJEC\u00a0when those exams are sat. We have in the past pulled together groups of people to look at issues like resources. So, during the last round of approvals, we pulled together interested parties in Welsh Government, regional consortia and WJEC\u00a0to look at resources that would be available with a view to facilitating the discussion about who would be best placed to fill the gaps where there may be perceived to be gaps in resources. Our other primary role is in maintaining standards.\u00a0So, as the regulator of qualifications, what we want to do is we want to make that the awards of qualifications\u2014so, the grades that people get\u2014are fair.\u00a0One of the things we do is set out the way in which the awarding bodies will set grades\u2014so, the awarding process, the methods that will be used\u2014and then we monitor WJEC's\u00a0award of grades against those processes. During a period of change, we prescribe the use of comparable outcomes as the primary approach, largely because comparable outcomes are designed for circumstances like this, where there's a change in a specification particularly, because there are any number of reasons, including resources, why performance may be different from one year to the next, but comparable outcomes is there to ensure that, all things being equal, if the cohorts have the same ability, the same grade should be awarded from one year to the next. We do recognise that there have been delays in textbooks. Much of that has been related to the timelines that we've all had to deliver new specifications against, which have been far from ideal for everybody involved. We think that particularly our role moving forward will be looking at the timelines for reforms\u00a0that will be necessary for the new curriculum to make sure that this situation isn't repeated and that there is sufficient time in future reforms to allow for greater system readiness. In terms of the roles of others, Welsh Government have a role at the moment in terms of grant funding of translation of materials into Welsh medium. And there is, through the common model at the moment\u2014and this is a model that is common between England and Wales\u2014a reliance on commercial publishers to provide textbooks. Now, that's something that probably needs to be looked at in the future in terms of potential\u00a0different models for how that might be achieved and also, potentially, around a paradigm shift in what's expected of those materials. So, I think that sets out Qualification Wales's position in particular."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Gareth."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Thank you very much. The WJEC does provide what's required in a regulatory sense, and there are two things there\u2014the specification, which tends to be very comprehensive in providing guidance in terms of drawing up a programme of teaching, and also exemplar assessments, which include marking, and those go to the regulator before they are published. So, those samples go to the regulator. The WJEC also do invest a great deal in resources that we produce digitally in both languages simultaneously. Each new course has substantial teaching guidance, which includes a great deal of useful information for teachers and pupils. And we run a professional development programme for teachers that is free of charge when courses are new, and then annually there is some charge for those events. They are face-to-face events, or, increasingly, they are webinars. The WJEC also encourages publishers to take an interest in providing textbooks. We don't have a commercial agreement with publishers. Indeed, the regulations as they stand in Wales, Northern Ireland and England preclude examination bodies from having commercial links with providers of textbooks, but that is something that emerges from the three-nation regime that existed in terms of qualifications. So, that is one point that we noted as something that needs to be considered for Wales as we move forward, whether it would be possible\u2014. As\u00a0we are not talking about examination boards competing with each other in Wales for GCSE and A-levels, in passing, that is something that I would want to suggest may deserve review. We encourage publishers to take an interest. At the moment, these tend to be England-based\u2014Hodder Education and Illuminate Education, for example\u2014and then the Welsh Government does provide funding to the WJEC to support the process of providing Welsh-language versions for those textbooks. So, we use that funding to provide editorial support to the process, and also to pay for translation costs, and we give significant guidance in terms of terminology. We have a language services team including excellent editors and translators within the WJEC, and we work closely with external translators too, and we use translation technology increasingly, which facilitates a great many things. Beyond that, I think the WJEC does see the need for flexibility, particularly when difficulties arise, and you heard there of some of the methods used by Mike and others to get digital resources available earlier than the print versions. And I should also note perhaps that, as the WJEC is very much involved with stakeholders, we feel that we do have a contribution to make in terms of ideas for the future."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. We heard in the video that teachers are spending a lot of their time actually translating materials. What is your view on that as a good use of teachers' time in Wales?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "I think the question of translation is an interesting one. There was talk about pupils translating and teachers translating. I think perhaps we need to understand what causes the need for that because, as I mentioned earlier, there are so many resources available digitally in both languages at the same time. Perhaps an interesting question is: is that source useful for teachers, being able to draw resources from two sources? Another interesting question, I think, is\u2014. The Welsh language, of course, is a language that is used in an educational context, but we are in a big world that's an English language world. I'm very aware that many of the websites we refer to in our resources and many of the case studies, as was mentioned in that video\u2014they are available\u00a0in English only.\u00a0Therefore, I think another interesting question is: can we discover what those additional resources are that are worth translating? And, certainly, it would be very unfortunate\u00a0if there were a dozen Welsh-medium schools, for example, translating material from the same website independently of each other. If there are a few websites, or a few case studies, in this big external\u00a0digital world that are worth translating, shouldn't we able to source those early? Because I don't think it's a good use of teachers' time. But I also think that the use of both languages\u00a0is an interesting\u00a0one. What is the vision in terms of teaching in a Welsh-medium class, in particular, perhaps, in the\u00a0A-level classes? I'm sure that some teachers feel that there is a way\u00a0of enriching\u00a0the\u00a0teaching by referring to terms in both languages, as well as explaining those terms in their own language. But the impression I got from the video was that there was quite a lot of mechanical translating happening, and\u00a0perhaps there is a need to understand more of the context."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Llyr on this."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Just to pick up on your point on the additional\u00a0materials, whose role would it be to asses\u00a0this or to take that overview, and then to respond to the demand?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Mike, in the WJEC, has conversations about resources in the team he's part of."}, {"speaker": "Mike Ebbsworth", "content": "Yes. That is extremely important\u2014to identify, as Gareth has just said, those materials that need to be translated, and not everything\u00a0needs to. We've made a lot of use recently of speaking with teachers and\u00a0the consortia, and ensuring\u00a0then that we are focusing on those things that need that attention."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "But would you\u2014? The question I'm asking is: would you still see that as a core part of your work, although\u00a0it's not necessarily essential in terms of the provision that you're required to provide?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Yes, we invest substantially from the WJEC budget into digital resources. So, through the types of conversations\u00a0that Mike mentioned, in terms of identifying needs, deciding on priorities with\u00a0teachers in individual subject areas, that can provide very useful\u00a0information\u00a0for us in terms of prioritisation. Of course, the digital packages that we create are already based on conversations\u00a0with teachers."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So, it's already happening to a certain extent."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Well, yes, but we could always go a step further."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "And do we need further resources for that?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Well, it's an interesting\u00a0question. The WJEC is doing as much as we can\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Why isn't it happening to the extent that it needs to happen, then?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "One can always do more, of course. The WJEC is trying to use its budget prudently, and most of our funding comes from payments made by schools and\u00a0colleges in terms of taking assessments. So, we do have a budget, but it's not a bottomless pit. So, we do need to make choices within the substantial budget we have in terms of the work that Mike is undertaking."}, {"speaker": "Mike Ebbsworth", "content": "There is a need to be careful as well in identifying resources and needs, and that those are suited towards the requirements. Quite often a teacher\u2014and I've been a teacher myself\u2014has this idea that there is a need to have everything. But, certainly, that's not always the case. Quite often, the focus is on different things. There has been a move towards different means of assessment over recent years, and we've moved our resources towards that to meet the needs of teachers on how to undertake\u00a0that sort of assessment."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Did you want to come in on any of this?"}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "I'm just going to say one thing. Teachers will want to be creative in the use of resources, and, in doing that, they'll potentially want to adapt resources from either language. I think one of the things that we would be quite keen to try and establish moving forward is what is the common core that should by default be available bilingually, and then what sits around that that would be for schools to use creatively and adapt. And what I wouldn't want to see is a default\u00a0position where all materials were bilingual\u2014a wide range of resources that might be created from all sorts of diverse, different channels\u2014because\u00a0that may inhibit the creation of some of those materials that may be more creative, which could then be used by teachers as they see appropriate. But I think it is reasonable to\u00a0expect for that core, common body\u00a0of knowledge\u00a0to be available bilingually by default, and for teachers not to have to spend time translating that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. A final question\u00a0from me, then. The \u00a3500,000 funding for Welsh-medium educational resource that's in the budget for 2018-19\u2014are you able to share any information\u00a0with the committee as to how that's going to be spent?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Tthe WJEC has some information in terms of that budget. It is a Welsh Government budget, and they have annual discussions with us as to what resources we are likely to be working on along with publishers, and where we would like to make a claim against that grant to pay for the editorial and translation costs that we will have incurred. Now, there have been conversations recently about possible support from that grant for some research work into the use of various materials and resources, and also, although this would be a very small part, a contribution towards seminars for publishers. But that isn't a full picture of the \u00a3500,000; I think you would have to ask the Welsh Government about the exact allocation of that total fund. But there may be some flexibility. We've just started this financial year; I'm sure there is some flexibility in their thinking in terms of the use of some of this resource. Do you want to add anything, Mike?"}, {"speaker": "Mike Ebbsworth", "content": "Certainly. We have contributed a list of publications, for example, that are ongoing, and they're aware of that, and a percentage of that funding then will go towards ensuring that those are there through the medium of Welsh."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Darren Millar."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "This is a huge mess, isn't it? It's a huge mess, which is causing lots of pressure and extra work for teachers, lots of pressure and extra work for learners, and is affecting the well-being of students, at a time when they need to be mentally fit, in order to go through the general stress that learners face when they have exams coming up. We know that the problems are not confined to Welsh-medium resources; they're also being experienced in English language resources as well, particularly in terms of the availability of textbooks. You've both mentioned\u2014both of your organisations have mentioned that there needs to be some sort of common core of resources available for learners and teachers, and I would agree with you on that front. But isn't a textbook a pretty basic element of anybody's toolkit for supporting a child getting through the information that they need to learn, and swot up on, in advance of exams?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "I think that the evidence is that different learners see their requirements differently. And I agree that a textbook is part of the picture that should be available. But I think the evidence also shows that not every young person will use them; perhaps the teacher uses them. There is an emphasis, for example, from one pupil there, on that traditional model of revision, namely class notes and his own revision notes, but that he personally also wanted a textbook. So, certainly, the content of a textbook is going to be important, and that that's available in some form or other. It was very interesting to know, for example, that when he was describing the traditional model of revision, he felt that he'd had quite a lot of the content of the textbook through the classroom notes. Much of that digital content, of course, corresponds to the content areas of a textbook, but it's just in a different form. But, in general, there should be a textbook. And some of our frustration as well is that the timetables of some individual publishers don't always get us to the point where there is a textbook available in time. That doesn't happen so often in English medium, but we know about that gap in time in the Welsh provision."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Well, it's happened fairly regularly in the English-medium textbook world, hasn't it? My daughter\u2014she featured in that video\u2014has got her RS qualifications coming up, and she only had a textbook over the Easter period. I mean, it's\u00a0completely unacceptable. And many others in that video are also being affected. You mentioned digital resources; not everybody's got access to digital resources in their own homes, even, in Wales. So, aren't we giving a significant disadvantage to those learners who might need the traditional 'swotting up\u00a0from a textbook' method\u00a0of revision and benefit from that?"}, {"speaker": "Mike Ebbsworth", "content": "We do ensure that those digital resources include things that the teachers can also print. Most of these are resources for teachers so that the teachers can\u00a0adapt them for their own use, to suit the learners who are in front of them at any given time. But\u00a0certainly there are materials there. If there are activities, then those\u00a0activities can be printed off and handed to pupils so that they can take them home. So, I would be\u00a0sceptical about that comment. We are thinking of the totality, ultimately."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "I think you're right that the\u00a0availability of technology is an\u00a0important part of this big picture. The young\u00a0people talk about websites and blogs, and we're talking about digital resources, so being able to reach those resources, I think, is vital in Wales.\u00a0It's interesting to note two contradictory remarks from the teaching\u00a0associations in the letters. One\u00a0praises what's available digitally, whereas another teaching\u00a0organisation sees this as more\u00a0work for teachers. As Mike said, we've\u00a0created those resources that can be adapted. One\u00a0teaching organisation says that it\u00a0just creates more work, while another\u00a0organisation says that the digital resource is something that's\u00a0very valuable. Of course, the headteacher at the end was praising the fact that, in a\u00a0situation of\u00a0crisis or\u00a0unacceptable timetables, we have succeeded in\u00a0creating some\u00a0resources that\u00a0will be in the textbook later, but\u00a0available digitally at an early stage. But I agree with your core comment that technology is vital, and access to that, and also the content of a textbook in some form is\u00a0vital as well."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Mr Blaker, you would agree that a textbook should be an essential core piece of the resource pack available for each qualification."}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "I think we wouldn't want to underplay the desirability of textbooks, recognising that different learners have different learning styles and may look to different resources. I think what I'd like to raise is a wider concern about textbooks in their current model, which is very much around the fact that\u00a0every time there's a change in a specification, there's a new textbook, which is designed around that specification and is endorsed by an awarding body, which is a nice model for a publisher, because every time there's a change, there's an opportunity for a new textbook. There are two concerns that I'd like to raise on that. First, the focus on teaching and learning. Ofsted and also Estyn have raised concerns about the focus in teaching on teaching to the test as a common concern in both nations. I have a concern that having a textbook that is endorsed by the awarding body and is designed specifically around that specification may lead to some of that tendency. And also, there's the sustainability of the model. We know that we're about to go into another round of reforms associated with the curriculum change. That's going to lead to another round of textbooks that may need to be focused on qualifications. I think I'd much rather see that textbooks are seen as a curriculum resource that are broader than, perhaps, the model of endorsement and the current model of publication suggest."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "So, you don't think that a textbook for each subject should be a core resource for pupils who are learning in advance of examinations."}, {"speaker": "Emyr George", "content": "I'd just like to pick you up on that. I think a textbook for each subject is absolutely an essential part of the broad range of resources that you'd want to see available for people to choose what they prefer, but on a subject, perhaps, rather than a specific specification, because I think there's a tendency to conflate the two, and much of the underlying content that is assessed in one specification, or a new updated specification, will remain unchanged. It is true that there may be a different focus or emphasis, or a different style of questioning, but that can be picked up more nimbly through supplementary digital resources, for example,\u00a0which can highlight that change, particularly to a teacher, so that they can shape their lesson planning around that. What we are looking at here are reformed GCSEs and\u00a0reformed A-levels in subjects that are well-established, traditional subjects, and so whilst it is not necessarily the ideal, I think it's\u00a0important to remember\u00a0that there is already a good deal of pre-existing resources, including textbooks, out there in schools already. We're not for a moment saying that that is the situation that we would want everybody\u00a0to be in. I think it might be preferable\u00a0if the textbook was perfectly bespoke to the course and didn't contain any extraneous\u00a0material, but that perhaps is an ideal picture and I think we do need to remember that there are already many resources out there that are available to teachers and to students."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "But of course, unlike their peers in perhaps other parts of the UK, we have teachers who are having to go meticulously\u00a0through some of these other resources that might be available to determine whether\u00a0they're appropriate for use in the classroom, given that the specification\u00a0is different in terms of the new qualifications. Can I just ask you about the disadvantage that some learners\u00a0might face as a result of the lack of textbooks? Mr Blaker, I note that you sought to reassure the committee in some of your opening remarks about the fact that equivalent outcomes are what you aim to achieve in discussion with the WJEC in terms of the outcome of assessments, and I think that that's a very positive thing. But, how do you differentiate between the different learning styles of individual students who are in that cohort to ensure that the disadvantage that one faces because\u00a0they're somebody who relies particularly\u00a0heavily on textbook-type learning, traditional\u00a0sort of swotting up for examinations, versus someone who is much more digitally aware and able to use digital resources\u2014? How do you make sure that it's fair to the cohort as a whole, while still enabling some of these individuals\u00a0for whom textbooks are important not to face disadvantage within that cohort?"}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "The systems that are in place are very much around making sure that awarding is fair across the whole cohort. It's very difficult\u2014in fact, it would be impossible\u2014to unpick all of the different factors that might affect performance, because\u00a0you could well have a textbook that's been available\u00a0for some time, it may be somebody's preferred leaning style to use a textbook, but did they use that textbook effectively? You know, did they open it in revision or did they not open it in revision? So, there are so many different factors that can affect individual\u00a0performance. I think it's impossible to unpick a particular aspect like the availability of resources. Motivation would be one thing, an individual\u00a0learner's motivation in the subject. The biggest input would be the quality of teaching. I think evidence has been provided to you by the regional\u00a0consortia, which we saw\u00a0yesterday. They particularly wanted to stress this point I think; that the quality of teaching is\u00a0probably the most dominant and the most important factor in relation to a learner's ultimate performance\u00a0in the examination."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "I understand that, but you also understand that someone who doesn't have the resources that they feel are best suited to them face some element of a greater disadvantage\u00a0than others for whom, perhaps, textbooks are less important."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "I think also, perhaps, related to that, it is important to mention digital literacy here. Every young person in Wales, I would hope, taking GCSE or A-level, should have that digital literacy in order to source\u00a0the valuable materials available\u2014that they should have those skills. Then, they have the choice whether they go down the digital route, or do they do as Mike suggested\u2014much of the digital material can be printed\u2014or do they then turn to textbooks, in the hope that those would be available? That would then allow for a pupil's personal learning choice to be reflected. It's also important for teachers to confirm that their ways of teaching do support these alternative approaches taken by pupils. Not every pupil will choose to learn or revise in exactly the same way. So, the flexibility for the pupil is very important, I think."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "I understand that, but I've got people in my constituency who haven't even got a broadband link at home, so there's a digital disadvantage as well. Can I just ask you about the reason why this has taking so long to sort out? It was back in 2015 that concerns were first raised\u00a0about the availability\u00a0of textbooks in both English and Welsh for the new qualifications. We're three years\u00a0on, what on earth has been happening in the interim and why is it taking so long? If you've got these resources digitally, why can't they just be compounded into textbooks pretty straightforwardly?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "I think the main reason for that is that there are three series of reforms of qualifications that have happened. There were some in 2015, other subjects in 2016, and other subjects in 2017. Those three cycles of reform have all suffered from the short timetable\u00a0that was between approving a qualification and publishers being able to start the work. Perhaps an interesting comparison would be a subject being taught for the first time in 2015\u2014where that subject has reached now in terms of resources. I would hope that each one of those subjects have more available now in terms of resources, and therefore we are adding each year\u2014not textbooks but digital resources. There are more past papers available, of course. We are working on sample work at the request of teachers. So, every subject is moving on over a period of time of five to six years while that specification is being studied. But those same difficulties have, unfortunately, affected 2015 subjects and 2017 subjects, and that's why we're discussing the same thing in 2018."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "So, it's the scale of the challenge and the volume of the work?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "I think Gareth, in the evidence that he has provided to the committee previously, has said about the timeline, the schedule, for reforms. Now, that's a schedule that we inherited and was largely dominated by the schedule for reforms in England. Now that we've reached a point of divergence in GCSEs and A-levels, between England and Wales, it gives us much more agency in the future to establish a timeline that doesn't place the pressures on the system. So, Gareth has quite\u00a0rightly pointed out that there are three waves of reforms, but the pressures that build up in the first wave are consequential onto the next wave and the wave after that. So, the whole system\u00a0has been pressured both from a regulatory perspective of the approval process, the awarding body preparing its submissions to use, and then system readiness\u00a0thereafter."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "That timeline was obviously set by the Welsh Government. I assume that advice was given by WJEC and Qualifications Wales and your predecessor organisation to the Welsh Government\u00a0at that time protesting about the timescale\u00a0that you were being expected to abide\u00a0by."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Yes, and similarly in England, the examination boards working in England would have provided the same advice to the Government there. And, of course, the Welsh Government programme was associated with the reform programme in England, in particularly for those A-level subjects, where there was a strong influence from the universities across the UK in terms of what they wanted to see differently in the A-level subjects. So, England and Wales have run on a very short timetable common to both countries, and I would say that every exam board and every publisher has seen this very challenging in Wales and England. But our advice is that there is a real need for between 18 months and two years from completing a specification that has been approved, then being able to work with teachers on what their needs and requirements will be, thinking about what the teaching programme will be, and then starting to work with publishers and get resources available\u2014ideally, with a year of preparation then for the teacher before they start teaching. So, as they will know what resources will be available, we'll be able to discuss the use of those resources in our professional development programmes, and then that timeline is convenient for everybody."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Darren, I've got to bring Llyr in now."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Estyn, NAHT, UCAC, NASUWT, WJEC and Qualifications Wales have pointed to the way in which the Government has managed the reforms that have been happening over the past few years as one of the things that has led to some of these difficulties. You mentioned the fact that they come wave upon wave. Well, what about the tsunami of curriculum reform that we're currently facing? That is, how confident can we be that the situation won't deteriorate as the new curriculum is introduced\u2014rather than improve?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "That is a very key question, isn't it? We have started to discuss this, specifically in particular in a forum that includes publishers in Wales, with the Welsh Government around the table and Qualifications Wales around the table. I think one of the very interesting questions and important questions is: what will\u00a0the nature of the information available in April 2019 be\u00a0in terms of the new curriculum? At what level of detail will it be? To what extent will it be adapted again after April 2019? Is it detailed enough, really, for teachers to start discussing their programmes of teaching, and that we then still have a role with publishers, even though this is for this curriculum and not for qualifications? WJEC has a tradition of publishing resources over the key stages and other key stages as well. I think there is a need to discuss the implications of the timetable as it starts to appear, because there is a need to start teaching the new curriculum in September 2022. If we're talking about a year of preparation, that brings us back to September 2021. If we're talking about working on resources available for that preparation year, we're talking about September 2020. So, the timetable does appear already tight, particularly if there's something that's not quite certain about that curriculum statement in 2019, and that there is a lot of work to turn that into teaching programmes. So, I think it is a key question, and I can't be confident at the moment that this is going to work."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Did you want to come in, Philip?"}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "I think one of the big differences is it's a tsunami we can see coming. So, young people will be assessed for the first time, assuming linear exams, in the summer 2027, which is some way away, and, actually, given the reform process historically, this is probably the most foresight\u00a0we've seen of a big change like this. There is a big dependency on the curriculum and the curriculum being described in such a way that we can relate qualifications to that curriculum, because qualifications should relate to the curriculum rather than drive the curriculum, so we do need to see something coming out of that. I think, for us, once we've seen the curriculum, and we've got better sight of it, we'll be able to plan things out. We've already started engagement with awarding bodies over the possible supply chain for these new qualifications, and, ultimately, there'll be a go/no-go decision that would need to be made, probably in 2023, which would be that if the conditions don't appear right for safe implementation, then we would make a recommendation to Welsh Government that these reforms are delayed in terms of the qualification, not in terms of the curriculum, for a year to allow the system to be able to catch up. So, we're starting to plan out not only the whole of the process, but also thinking about where we might have to make key decisions."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Just one very brief comment in that context: I think that the comment of the consortia jointly is important there. They emphasise, in the context of the curriculum, the importance of the autonomy of teachers in interpreting and providing, therefore I think we truly need to discuss that. Does that suggest that there won't be so much need for national resources, or are those resources required to support that autonomy in any case? We need to discuss that at an early stage and in detail, I think."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Yes, certainly, and one is concerned that that conversation isn't already happening, but, yes, okay, you've made that point clearly. If I could return, therefore, to the commercial issue\u2014clearly, there is a shortage of providers in Wales, and we are reliant on others. You suggested that the WJEC may be interested in stepping up and taking some sort of role if regulations were changed. I assume that that would be something that you would be eager to see happening in terms of the change to regulation in that context."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Yes, and we've been part of starting that discussion amongst publishers in Wales. Certainly, there is interest. I think that I haven't described correctly the purpose of a seminar to encourage interest: the interest is there, but there needs to be an understanding of what the implications are of working towards that kind of\u00a0timetable, what the implications are of working in two languages, what kind of business model, perhaps, would be suitable for the publishers in Wales, how much certainty could be given to them that there is a period of work, because they would want to build their teams, and develop skills within those teams, and to have enough certainty that this is worth doing. And therefore, those are the sort of issues that we're starting a discussion on, in the hope of having a discussion in June to move that forward. Of course, Welsh Government, Qualifications Wales and other stakeholders are part of this discussion, not only WJEC, but we've been part of initiating that discussion."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Is this developing at the pace that you would like to see it developing?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Yes, I think, and there is some enthusiasm. For example, a number of publishers in Wales are within an association describing itself as Cwlwm Cyhoeddwyr Cymru. Myrddin ap Dafydd is chair of Cwlwm at the moment, and there is enthusiasm and vision, certainly. So, there's a wonderful opportunity, I think, for Wales to interpret\u00a0these possibilities swiftly and then hopefully take action on them."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "And we're talking here not just about translating but developing resources, and the point, I think, is an important one around some of the evidence that we've received about the importance of developing resources naturally bilingually from the very beginning, rather than having to translate something. Because\u00a0there have been comments that translations are clunky, difficult to follow and not\u2014I'm not saying that they're not fit for purpose, but certainly don't facilitate teaching, perhaps, as easily as one would wish."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Yes, I would agee, and that begins with the authors, doesn't it? We must have the authors\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So, the expertise, and the same capacty with the publishers as well."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Yes, and we do want to nurture authors within Wales, particularly given that the new curriculum has to do justice to a Welsh dimension within the curriculum in so many different subjects. So, we need authors who can be developed, and authors who would be willing to work with the publishers. That's a very specific theme within one of the ideas of the seminars with publishers."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Would that market be viable without any sort of subsidy, if it were to develop bilingually? Or do we have to accept that they have to have an element\u00a0of public subsidy?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Our view in the WJEC is that subsidy will be necessary. But we could\u00a0rethink the model for the subsidy, perhaps. At the moment, the subsidy is described as a subsidy for the Welsh-medium version. Why not rethink that and think of a subsidy for producing resources in two languages for the Welsh curriculum? And perhaps we would need a little more funding for that. But there will be organisations such as the WJEC who will still be interested in contributing, because we are a charity, and within our mission is investment in various things\u00a0that supports education in Wales."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "But in terms of where we are now, resources have to be translated. I struggle at times to understand why it takes so much time to translate a resource. I would like to know better, perhaps, what the main barriers are in that sense. But also, how long is acceptable to wait for a translation, in your view?"}, {"speaker": "Mike Ebbsworth", "content": "We've done a great deal of work recently, over recent years, to ensure that that delay between having an English version and a Welsh version is reduced. We are highly aware of the fact that the best-case scenario is that the Welsh and the English are available simultaneously. In those terms, we've taken huge steps forward with the publishers that we've named this morning, so that we have discussed translation as the textbook is being produced. There is a risk there, of course. The nature of books is that the author may change his or her mind, or edit as he or she is writing. Well, with that model, we would have to ensure that we approved as we moved forward, chapter by chapter perhaps, so that there would be no changes to be made from then on. At the end of the process, then, the publishers in England have agreed to hold the English version back for a period of time until the Welsh version is available, and then to publish both simultaneously. Unless that timetable is followed throughout the process, there are inherent risks in that process, of course, as I've mentioned in terms of translation as we author materials, and in ensuring that that timetable is stuck to."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "And perhaps there is a need to emphasise that the process is translation and editing as a package, and that sometimes the same amount of time goes on the editing, how the Welsh works in terms of diagrams and things that aren't text necessarily\u2014pictures and so forth. So, eight weeks, I think, is the time that we've succeeded in agreeing with the publishers so that we can turn around the Welsh version in that period of time."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Darren."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "I just want to ask about this eight-week delay. So, you\u2019re telling us, Mr Ebbsworth, that the WJEC has agreed with Hodder and Illuminate that, in future, even if an English textbook is available for publication, and it\u2019s already late, you will further delay the availability of that textbook so that it can be published on the same day as the Welsh-medium textbook?"}, {"speaker": "Mike Ebbsworth", "content": "We can only work on those books that are in the process of being developed. Naturally, if something is late in English, then that timetable would be affected in terms of\u00a0a decision that\u00a0will ultimately have to be taken. But that's the hope: that when new textbooks are produced in English and authored in English, we would look at that eight-week period as a turnaround."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "I understand the point that you made earlier about the chapter-by-chapter approach, which seems much more equitable. But to suggest that you will delay books that could be available for students and could be available for teachers to be able to access by two months because you haven't got the systems in place to be able to produce them on the same day, seems to be wholly inappropriate. Can I ask, also, why on earth it isn't possible to produce Welsh-medium textbooks first and then translate them to English on occasions?"}, {"speaker": "Mike Ebbsworth", "content": "We're entirely open to that and to that sort of model."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "So, why has that never ever been done?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Well, of course, it would happen with subjects that stem from Wales, but I think the problem is that we work with publishers and those publishers and their authors, therefore, tend to work through the medium of English. But, just to be clear, this idea of delaying an English version is something that the Welsh Government is eager for us to experiment with, but not with textbooks that are already late. They are within the new programme of textbooks that are contained within the grant that you mentioned of \u00a3500,000. So, in a way, this is an experiment and the Welsh Government wants to look at this as one way of responding to the complaint that there are different timetables available."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "So, you're being forced to do this by the Welsh Government, rather than\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Well, we've agreed to do it in discussion with them."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "So, are you happy with that approach?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Well, as long as the textbook isn't late in the first place, then yes; it's worth trying. There is a challenge on the eight weeks, there is a challenge in the publisher sticking to the timetable in terms of the English version first of all, but we are willing to use this as a test bed, and we're working on two specific textbooks on this."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "I think the committee is struggling with this idea, so what do you understand to be the rationale behind that, then? Is it that both sets of pupils should be equally disadvantaged?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Well, no, in a way, it uses the same principle as we have regarding our use of digital resources. With the digital materials, the intention is that things are available\u00a0in time and that they're available in both languages at the same time. So, trying to imitate that with printed text is what we're trying to do, but not with texts that are already late. So, if these books keep to the timetable, then they will be available in time in both languages, but that the English version has stayed before going out on the shelves."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So, that's to say that the English version will be completed eight weeks beforehand so that you have eight weeks for translation."}, {"speaker": "Mike Ebbsworth", "content": "Well, ultimately, I may have used the wrong words in saying that we're holding the English back. The English version would still be in the process, just as the Welsh version would be, and then they would catch up as they approach the date for publication and printing. There is an element of editing the English as well as the Welsh and that would happen in that\u00a0eight-week period. So, a draft\u00a0form might be available, and we do ensure that our draft versions are available on our secure website as soon as possible, but then that has to be held up before publication."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. John."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Just on that, Chair, it's nonetheless the case, as we've heard, I think, and as the letter to the committee from Kirsty Williams has made clear, that there might be a situation where the English-language version of a textbook could be made available, but it isn't made available because there isn't a Welsh-language version. And, as the\u00a0Chair said, is that\u00a0about putting those students in Wales on the same footing, and if so, how does that\u00a0relate to the\u00a0fact that\u00a0these students, including those who could have had earlier access to the English-language version, are competing with students over the border, as we heard on the video earlier, for those precious university places? Doesn't it place the English-language student using the English-language version at a potential disadvantage, compared to students over the border?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "I think this is a point for Qualifications Wales to a certain extent, but applicants for qualifications in Wales are assessed as a national cohort, if truth be told, so, each piece of information we have on the standards is evaluated for that national cohort. The standards stem from the three-nation system. So, in discussion with Qualifications Wales, we ensure that there is no disadvantage to any cohort in Wales in any subject, be that because of a textbook being unavailable or for any other reason."}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "Certainly, from a comparable outcomes perspective, the fewer differences that there are that are differential\u2014. So, the idea of textbooks being available in English and Welsh at different times could potentially create another dimension in terms of disparity. So, if we're looking at it strictly speaking from a comparable outcomes perspective, it makes the awarding easier if everybody's on a common playing field. It's worth remembering\u2014we provided some evidence in our original letter particularly looking at religious studies on the basis that religious studies was a subject that had been mentioned. This subject has already been awarded at AS-level last year, so it has gone through an award and will go through the full A-level award this year. The comparable outcomes approach did protect those learners last year, in the absence of a textbook, and we saw stability in the results that came out of the cohort level. Similarly, with other subjects that have gone through reforms, we've seen it with the GCSEs that were awarded last year, ASs that were awarded last year and A-levels\u00a0that were awarded last year: we saw good comparability year on year."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Go on then, Darren. Is that okay, John?"}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Just a very brief follow-up on that, at the cohort level, yes, you suggest that there is some evidence that students were protected, but what you don't know and can't tell, because you're not able to drill down to the individual student level, is whether children, young people, were disadvantaged as a result of their learning style being more textbook orientated than that of their peers."}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "I guess we're in a situation where there's no evidence either way that that\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "The absence of evidence doesn't mean that it didn't happen."}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "No, but there is no evidence to suggest that. We have no positive evidence to suggest that."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Well, I think you've seen plenty of evidence about the stress that it's causing, and the concern that learners have about their outcomes. I think it would be very interesting, actually, to take some teacher assessments and expected grades and compare those to the actual grade outcomes. Is that something that Qualifications Wales could do on a sample basis?"}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "Historically, that sort of evidence has been very unreliable. Gareth would probably have a stronger view on that than me. Predicted grades used to be provided. Certainly, back in my day at an awarding body they were provided, and there tended to be a very low correlation between the predicted grade and the actual achieved grade. I don't know if you've got anything on that, Gareth."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "No, we agree with you that the comparisons are not that reliable, because there are so many factors. But I think, at the end of the day, what we see is, yes, I agree there is evidence of stress, but I think there's also evidence of young people and their teachers really using the available resources and the available skills in approaching revision and preparation, and tending to do that very well. That's the evidence that we've got, for example, in the AS religious studies last year, that the cohort did extremely well in fact. We can't disagree that there's evidence of stress, but I think we can also point towards resilience and excellent approaches to drawing together the various sources that they've got: classroom notes, revision notes, as they mentioned, and the various other materials that they referred to."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. John."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Coming back to the effect of the lack of resources, we heard on the video, as you've just mentioned, Gareth, that pupils were experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety, and it affected their well-being in terms of their perception that they might be disadvantaged by the lack of resources, as we discussed. We know exam time is very, very stressful\u2014I'm sure all of us would agree with that\u2014in general, without any additional problems or perceptions of problems. So, with that sort of background, would you accept then that some students have been negatively affected by the lack of suitable support materials for general qualifications? I know we've discussed this in terms of it being difficult, perhaps, to show cause and effect, but I think most people watching that video would clearly come to the view that some students have been negatively impacted. Would you accept that?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "I'd have to agree. There is evidence of their concern, isn't there? But as Philip said, what we don't have is evidence that that anxiety then has an impact on their attainment, because there are so many factors, there are so many different kinds of resources that they've referred to\u2014even those who want to see textbooks, they're also talking about so many other materials that are available to them. Of course, it's also clear that they are conscientious young people who have worked hard, so you have a picture there of young people who are concerned, yes, and as you've said, examinations are a stressful time in general, but they are also young people who are doing their level best, and usually do get the results that they have worked for. That's the evidence that we have: the results tend to be achieved."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Coming back again to matters that we've already discussed, but just to put to you in a fairly focused way, would you accept that it isn't fair that some pupils are not having the support material that others are having, depending on whether their particular subject is involved and the language that they're studying through? Would you accept that that is a basic unfairness in the system as it currently exists?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Ideally, resources, digital accessibility and digital literacy should be available for every pupil on an equal basis. But I think perhaps if we analysed this in much detail, different individuals would be able to say, 'There are different types of unfairness.' You referred earlier to the digital inequalities. Is there an economic inequality? There is some evidence from the teaching unions that suggests that not every school is in the same situation as each other in terms of buying the resources that are available. So, I think your question drives at a very important point: what sort of inequality could be having an impact on young people in terms of their achievement during their school time? Ideally, each one of those elements of potential inequality should be levelled. So, I don't think I can go any further than acknowledging that any inequality is unfair, but there are so many different kinds and the textbook is not the only one, and therefore we're not going to be able to analyse the impact of that on its own."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Could I put to you, finally then, what Estyn have said about reported delays in the production and distribution of educational resources such as textbooks, marking criteria and specimen papers, that that delay has impeded the ability of teachers to plan adequately, and that this effect on their ability to plan adequately is very likely to have had an impact on pupils' achievement? Would you accept that?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "It's interesting\u2014they link three quite different things there, don't they? We've discussed the textbooks in some detail. When they refer to sample assessments, we have to provide those within the regulatory time frame, and they have to be approved. So, in every subject there are sample assessments and marking schemes, and they are statutorily available, in a way. When they talk about exemplars, there are different interpretations of that. One request that we receive often from schools is for exemplars in terms of the work of pupils that has been assessed and marked by us. Of course, they're not available until the young people have taken those exams for the very first time. We can make them available digitally, and through various other methods. But in some subjects the demand has been so strong that we have worked with schools in order to ensure that work is produced by pupils before that first examination, is marked by us, and is then made available. So, we can respond to that demand when it arises. I would like to have a conversation with Estyn, indeed, to interpret on a more detailed level some of the things that they refer to."}, {"speaker": "Emyr George", "content": "May I offer a comment on that quote from Estyn? They talk about a reduction in attainment and that, to some extent, brings us back to the point in terms of the comparable outcomes method that we're talking about. That method is based on research and evidence that says that in a period of change to an exam or qualification, we know that performance in an exam can fall, and that is due to a number\u00a0of different factors. Teachers aren't as familiar with the specification and the requirements of the exam. There are fewer past assessment resources available; there aren't any past papers, for example. Certainly, knowing that you're the first to sit that exam perhaps raises your concerns about that examination, and examinations are a matter of concern already. It's very difficult, if not impossible, to differentiate between those factors, but what we know on the whole is that they come together to have an impact on pupils' performance in an exam, and that's why, when it comes to awarding qualifications for the first time and looking at the grades, we look very carefully at what that the mark means in terms of the grade in order to try as best as we can, on the level of the whole national cohort, to eliminate as much unfairness as possible because they are the first cohort to sit the exam."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Could I just make a brief comment on the sample assessments? Now, interestingly, when the English, Welsh, maths, and maths and numeracy GCSEs were new, the Welsh Government were very eager that we invest in more sample assessment materials. We had to produce one for the regulator, but they wanted to see us produce far more, and we did that. But there are risks inherent in that, too. If we create more and more sample assessments, then does that create more risk of teaching to the test? And every time we produce one of these, of course, we are using robust assessment ideas, and they're out there to be used for test purposes. So, we need to be careful that we don't weaken\u00a0the real assessment by providing too many of the examiners' good ideas in the sample material. So, it's an interesting theme, but it would be interesting\u00a0to have a further conversation with Estyn on that."}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "I just wanted to say, looking towards\u2014. Reforms always throw up issues like this. It's almost an inevitability of any change that there will be impact. I think what we need to do is we need to think about the future reforms, particularly knowing that we've got some on the radar already, and to think about what this paradigm is and how we can isolate some of these factors in the future. So, if we look at resources and if we look particularly at textbooks as being a curriculum resource, rather than a qualification resource, I think we can change the timeline to which some of those materials are produced. So, going back to when I studied my A-levels in the 1980s, there was this common body of knowledge that was an A-level textbook in biology that wasn't focused around an individual awarding body. When we talked to unions about this on Monday, they said, 'Yes, when we used to teach many years ago, there were curriculum resources like that, and then when a particular topic or a particular area of content dropped out of the qualification, we either did or didn't teach it according to whether it was in the curriculum'. That's a little bit worrying by virtue of the fact there might have been a component of that subject that didn't get taught because it was no longer in the text, despite the fact that it was in the common body of knowledge. But I think if we can shift this paradigm\u2014and I would really like to a shift in the paradigm for resources particularly, away from the focus on the qualification and into more of a focus on the curriculum\u2014then that provides an opportunity for, I would suggest, a much healthier model in the future. There are various ways of doing that. In the United States, for example, there are some states within the United States that produce a state textbook. Now, that can have issues, particularly if it's politically orientated\u2014so, if politicians are seen to have a strong influence in the content that's taught. But\u00a0if there is independence in that state model, then I think that can be quite strong model. Equally, if you look at somewhere like Hong Kong, they've actually tried to de-emphasise textbooks. So, Hong Kong, which is a very high-performing jurisdiction, is trying to move away from that model in the future."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Could I just add very, very briefly\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Very briefly, because I want to bring Hefin in."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "I know that, in our letter to you, we emphasised that this is not just to do with the body of knowledge.\u00a0The assessment objectives have shifted in many subjects towards analysis and evaluation. So, therefore, we really do need resources that support that way of working, and I'm sure that lots of the young people we've heard from\u2014what they're really doing in\u00a0their revision is actually not just studying the content, but thinking about how they respond analytically and evaluatively.\u00a0In fact, an interesting question for us as an awarding body to debate with the qualifications regulator, maybe, is whether some of the content should actually be able to be taken into the assessment hall.\u00a0Do young people need to remember all these terms and their precise definitions, sometimes in both languages if they've learnt it in that way? Shouldn't some of the reference material be more and more available in the assessment arena? And then you are really getting towards analysis and interpretation and evaluation."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Hefin."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I want to welcome these particular comments, because having come from a higher education background, what I've tried to deliver in my courses are\u00a0textbook-free modules, where you're relying on academic journal articles and you're piecing together the story yourself, based on the curriculum you develop yourself. So, curriculum-focused resources are very welcome. I fear that students who are nurtured on a textbook diet,\u00a0when they go to university, they are not expected to repeat what's in the textbook;\u00a0they're expected to do exactly as Gareth says and analyse and combine information into a discursive argument. So, therefore, I'm interested to know how you've worked with higher education to develop that approach. I also welcome what you've just said too."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Can I ask for brief answers, please?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Yes, well some of the people who provide\u00a0ideas into our digital resources certainly are either teachers who are very well aware of that progression to HE and therefore what their learners want or, in some cases, they are HE\u00a0people themselves. We do draw on a body of expertise, and we are more than willing to emphasise the importance of that approach to the support resources we provide."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I think the difficulty and the difference is that, at HE\u00a0level, the kind of journal articles that are available are probably not consumable at GCSE level. That's part of the problem you have with that approach."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Yes. And I think, interestingly\u2014I know we've pointed towards some of our\u00a0religious studies\u00a0resources as examples\u2014I think some of the websites\u00a0we point to are quite ambitious. They would be described as scholarly, and I think some of the young people on the video made that point, didn't they\u2014that they need to engage with that material to understand some themes? But we need to assist them in doing so. We need to almost make those scholarly items that are worth including in their curriculum accessible and user friendly for them at their point of learning."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Philip."}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "It was just one point. We recently published a report on the Welsh baccalaureate and skills challenge certificate, and I think it's relevant to pull in at this point that the independent study that pupils would be expected to do through the skills challenge certificate in doing their project work is really designed to try and draw out some of those skills that would be relevant in higher education.\u00a0Through the reforms that we are starting to think about for the skills challenge certificate, there's a real opportunity to start honing some of those skills, particularly at the advanced level bacc,\u00a0to make people really HE-ready so that they're better able to engage with that different style of learning. So, I think there's a huge opportunity that shouldn't be diminished within the advanced Welsh bacc."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Last questions from Mark then."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Gareth, can I just put to you\u2014? On the Estyn criticism, I think you've answered one aspect of their criticism that WJEC\u00a0did not make as many sample assessment materials available as schools would have liked early on in the reform process, and I understand your position there,\u00a0but they went on and said, 'At times the sample assessment materials were provided\u00a0with incorrect mark schemes' and also, 'It would be\u00a0helpful if the WJEC\u00a0ensure that all necessary resources were made available before the start date of each qualification.' Do you have a response to those points?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Again, probably, I'd like a conversation with them about any problems with the specimen assessments and their mark schemes, because if they are the statutory regulatory ones they would have gone through Philip's team as well or his Welsh Government predecessors as regulators, depending on which qualifications they were. Obviously, we need to be spot-on with those. Very occasionally,\u00a0somebody will identify an error, and obviously we then correct them, because\u00a0these are available digitally online. So, if there is a problem, we want to hear about it and then we can correct it. But, yes, I agree with their fundamental premise, that ideally the whole package of resources should be available before teaching starts, including, as we mentioned earlier, so we can draw on that set of resources in the events we run as WJEC free of charge for teachers leading up to the first teaching. We need that information ourselves as well so we can talk about the use of these\u00a0valuable resources in an appropriate pedagogical context in that preparatory year. So, the ideal is that everything is there 12 months ahead."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "So, what mechanism do you have for picking up on this type of criticisms from Estyn and having that conversation with them? Has that not happened?"}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "We have met with Estyn a couple of times recently, actually\u2014once when they were beginning their review of the key stage 4 qualifications\u00a0that had been in place for two years\u00a0and a bit, and also when they were planning a review of some of the A-level work. Because\u00a0we do have regular meetings with them, we will have an opportunity to explore their comments here I'm sure."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Looking at the structure and the relationship between Qualifications\u00a0Wales and the WJEC\u2014. I understand in the model in England\u2014you've got Ofqual, the regulator, and you have various\u00a0competing\u00a0exam boards, some I think with for-profit motivation. We don't have\u00a0that in Wales; there is a sole regulator and a single, dominant examination board. Does that mean that there's significant overlap and potentially cost duplication between the work of the two bodies, particularly\u00a0given WJEC is a charity and seems to have many of the same objectives as you in Qualifications Wales have?"}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "The roles are very distinct, so I'd tell you there's\u00a0no overlap. What we try and do is try and make sure that there's a good connection between the work that we do. WJEC has very clear responsibilities\u00a0around the delivery of qualifications. We have a role in monitoring to ensure that those qualifications are delivered securely and fairly. I would say a strength of the Welsh\u00a0model is that there is an independent regulator and a single awarding body largely, because\u00a0much of the work that Ofqual would need to do in terms of its maintenance of standards is about ensuring that the competition between awarding bodies doesn't lead to what's been termed in the past as a race to the bottom in terms of standards. Now, the opportunity that we have in Wales is, where we have a single awarding body, we can have a close and good working relationship\u00a0with WJEC, but guarding\u00a0very strongly to make sure that we keep that regulatory distance to make sure that we preserve our role as the regulator and look at WJEC as one of our regulated bodies."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Can I make a general point? Perhaps the important opportunity in Wales is to look anew at how national and regional organisations, such as the consortia, can collaborate to make a success of the broad range of resources and CPD that will be required to support the new curriculum, and also the next set of qualifications that will be reformed. We've referred to many organisations today, but there are others. The Welsh Books Council, for example, is part of this discussion. The Learned Society of Wales is a player that wants to introduce ideas into the Welsh dimension of the curriculum. There was mention of the HE sector earlier. Teachers' associations have very specific comments to make on some of these areas. There is a great opportunity for us to come together and to have a national approach. There will be a need for some financial resource from the Welsh Government\u2014yes, certainly\u2014and the WJEC can provide some resources, but I think we all want to collaborate in order to ensure the success of the next round of resources."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "But doesn't that national approach and collaboration preclude the model that Philip was talking about\u00a0earlier, where we had textbooks based on the curriculum, and there's that core, but that was separate from what the exam body decided to do and the textbook wasn't there for the particular exam approach? If you have a single, dominant exam board, and you have a Welsh curriculum that's developed with that board, how do you then have this separation\u00a0between textbook and exam?"}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "So, if we look at qualification, a qualification should be based on the curriculum that's being offered, because learning should be based around the curriculum, and the role of the qualification is to measure attainment against knowledge of that curriculum\u2014knowledge, skills and understanding, the dispositions that that curriculum is trying to develop. So, I think there are two very distinct things. Now, of course, what will inevitably happen is once the curriculum is known and developed, there will be a level of detail that comes across from what the qualification is looking for. I think what we're trying to say is, from an educational perspective, what we'd like to see is a broader focus on the curriculum and less of a narrow focus on the qualification and some of the problems that that can drive, so that, if a learner is well-versed in the curriculum and has been taught well and has acquired the knowledge, skills and dispositions that the curriculum is trying to create, they should succeed in the qualification."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "And you suggested earlier that, if need be, the qualification could be pushed back a year, but not the curriculum. Does that mean that it would be possible to teach the new curriculum while keeping the old qualification?"}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "It would be possible."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "But satisfactory?"}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "Because, if we're looking at qualifications predominantly being 14 to 16, what Professor Donaldson said at the very beginning, with 'Successful Futures', was, actually, if the curriculum is preparing people better for that qualification stage, so that they're better versed as learners and better able to perform in those qualifications and we see a rise of attainment\u2014. Ideally,\u00a0you'd be in a position where you've got GCSEs that have been reformed to marry up to any change, but I don't see there being a huge problem in itself of a delay if we think that is the right thing to do. Clearly, we consider that to be a sub-optimal thing. We would much rather be in a position of having reforms, but, equally, I'd want to see any reforms delivered safely, and I wouldn't want to compromise fairness and safety of delivery of those qualifications on the basis of a timeline. But I think all too often the case is that a timeline dominates over doing what is the right thing and I think as we get further into this we'll have to really assess and keep a grip of what's the right thing to do."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Very briefly, Darren."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Just on this issue of shaping the curriculum and making sure that we've got textbooks that can be used to support the delivery of the curriculum\u2014. So, obviously, the WJEC's interested in the examinations and the qualifications. That's your role as well in terms of Qualifications Wales. So, who should be responsible for developing these curriculum resources?"}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "I think, for a new model, that needs to be determined. Welsh Government has a role in curriculum at the moment. They have responsibility for curriclum and they've already started work with the seminar last year, and then drawing people together now to look at a new model for the future. I think we need to evolve that approach, and I think Welsh Government taking a lead on some of this thinking about how things might be prepared for the future is probably a good position to be in at the moment."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Are there any other models that you can point us to in terms of how these things are done elsewhere?"}, {"speaker": "Philip Blaker", "content": "Yes, there are models where you can have\u2014. For example, in Northern Ireland, you have the regulator, the awarding body and the curriculum body all under one roof. So, you can have a position where everything is tied together as it is in Northern Ireland with the\u00a0Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment. Equally, if you look at somewhere like Hong Kong, you have very distinct bodies that are looking after each individual component. So, there are lots of different models that can be developed. But, of course, in Wales, and also previously in England, the qualifications regulator has also had a responsibility for curriculum. So, there has been that model in the past in Wales."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Just very briefly."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Really quickly, please."}, {"speaker": "Gareth Pierce", "content": "Just one thing very briefly, in terms of the WJEC. I mentioned earlier that, in the past, the WJEC has produced a fair few resources in collaboration with publishers in key stage 3 and even at primary stages. Certainly, key stage 3 is closely linked to GCSE, and, therefore, if the WJEC continues to be a player\u2014as I hope it will\u2014in the area of resources for GCSE and A-level, then the WJEC is also well positioned in terms of our investment in editing, translating and the use of technology to contribute to key stage 3 most certainly and perhaps even the primary stages.

Over the past few days, we've seen horrific reports of police violence against black men and women south of the border, but these are not isolated incidents or elsewhere problems. Prejudice, discrimination and violence are a lived reality for far too many people. They are a result of systems that far too often condone, normalize, perpetrate and perpetuate inequality and injustice against people of colour. As a country, we are not concerned bystanders simply watching what is happening next door. We are part of it. The calls for justice, for equality and for peace are found echoed in our communities, because anti-black racism is happening here, everywhere in Canada, every single day. This is something that our own staff, cabinet ministers and colleagues face even in these halls. Over the past few days, I've heard many of these personal stories directly from them. I'm not just talking about acts of violence. I'm also talking about microaggressions, which many of us may not even see. That is the daily reality of far too many racialized Canadians, and it needs to stop. When it comes to being an ally, I have made serious mistakes in the past, mistakes that I deeply regret and continue to learn from. I want to thank my colleagues, community leaders and fellow Canadians for opening my eyes to what is really going on in our communities and for helping me better understand both privilege and power. I'm not perfect, but not being perfect is not a free pass to not do the right thing. It's not an excuse to not step up, stand up for each other, be an ally. I know that for so many people listening right now, the last thing you want to hear is another speech on racism from a white politician. I'm not here today to describe a reality I do not know or to speak to a pain I have not felt. I'm here because I want you to know that our government is listening. We hear your calls for justice, equality and accountability. We acknowledge your frustration, your anger, your heartbreak. We see you.  Since coming to office, our government has taken many concrete steps to fight anti-black racism, systemic discrimination and injustice across the country. We are working directly with the communities and their leaders to close the gaps that persist in Canada. For example, we have provided $9million to support programs for black Canadian youth. We have made significant investments to enable the Public Health Agency of Canada to provide more mental health services to people who have experienced racism or intergenerational trauma. We are helping community organizations to obtain funding to purchase equipment or lease space. We have also created the anti-racism secretariat, which has an envelope of $4.6million, to address systemic barriers, such as employment, justice and social participation, that perpetuate injustice. We have made progress, but we know the work is far from being done.  Over the past five years, our government has worked with communities to recognize and address injustices. We've taken action to support community organizations, invest in better data and fight racism. While we've made some progress, there is still so much more to do, because here are the facts in Canada: Anti-black racism is real. Unconscious bias is real. Systemic discrimination is real. For millions of Canadians, it is their daily, lived reality. The pain and damage it causes are real too. Mr. Chair, every Canadian who has felt the weight of oppression, every student who has the courage to demand a better future, every person who marches and posts and reads and fights, from Vancouver to Montreal to Halifax, expects more than the status quo. They expect more and deserve better.  The Government of Canada has a lot of work to do, but we're ready. We're ready to work with our opposition colleagues, community leaders and Canadians to make our country a more just and fair place. Racism never has a place in this country, and we will do everything we can to eradicate it from coast to coast to coast.

The video is painful to watch. No one should ever have to plead for help while a crime is being committed, ignored by other members of law enforcement. The tragedy triggered marches, occupations, protests and, unfortunately, riots. However, I hope it has mostly sparked conversations. Racism is real, painful and unacceptable.  No one should ever feel unsafe because of the colour of their skin, especially around police officers who have a duty and a responsibility to uphold the law for all.

Our nation has benefited immensely from great Canadians who overcame prejudices and discrimination to serve their communities and make Canada a better country: Lincoln Alexander, elected as a Conservative in 1968, was the first black member of Parliament and went on to become the first black cabinet minister; John Ware was born into slavery in South Carolina but, following the American Civil War, was a leading figure in bringing the first cattle to Alberta and spearheading the ranching industry that would become the backbone of the province; Josiah Henson escaped slavery to become a thriving businessman in Ontario; and of course, Viola Desmond challenged segregation in Nova Scotia. Black Canadians throughout history have not just built this nation with their contributions; they have also represented Canada with excellence and pride on the world stage, like Harry Jerome, who represented Canada in three Olympic Games and won a bronze medal in 1964. He would go on to become a teacher in British Columbia, once again serving with excellence to try to make a better world for the next generation. Throughout our history, black Canadians have put their lives on the line for their fellow Canadians, bravely serving around the world in our armed forces. While there are many things we can point to in our history with pride, that is not to say that we have a perfect record, nor that we are immune to the threat of racism or that anti-black racism is just an American problem. Canada has had its own dark episodes of racism that cannot be ignoredsadly, not just in our past. Every day, there are people who experience discrimination or racism in some form. Throughout this pandemic, we have seen a troubling spike in anti-Asian racism. No one should be attacked in their community or targeted on the bus because of the colour of their skin. Nor should places of worship be broken into and desecrated, like the synagogue in Montreal. The Conservatives condemn all acts of anti-semitism, racism and discrimination. In a peaceful and free country like Canada, there is absolutely no room for intolerance, racism or extremism of any kind.  But the violence and destruction we have seen in response are not the answer. Millions of people are protesting peacefully across the United States and in Canada, and we must always protect the rights of people who are protesting peacefully and within the law for a just cause and separate them from those who exploit tragedies to commit acts of violence. Mr. Floyd's brother, Terrence, said that violence will not bring his brother back. Instead, he has called for peace and justice and urged the crowds to educate themselves and to vote. Out of such tragedy, Mr. Chair, that is a powerful message about how each one of us can use our democratic rights to effect change. In a peaceful and free country like Canada, there is absolutely no room for intolerance, racism and extremism of any kind. We are not born believing we are better than one another. We are all created in the image and likeness of God, and because of that, we are all equal. An infinite value exists in each one of us.  Canada is an incredibly diverse country. Canada is a nation of immigrants that stands on the traditional territories of first nations, Inuit and Mtis people. Waves of newcomers have come to Canada for a better life because our country is built on a rock-solid foundation of enduring values, democratic institutions, the rule of law and fundamental and universal human rights. Everyone comes here because Canada is built on solid values, democratic institutions, and respect for the rule of law, as well as for fundamental, universal human rights. We must absolutely protect these values, because they are what sets us apart. They allow Canada to offer what so many other countries simply cannot. There are those who say that diversity is our strength, and that is true, but it doesn't quite capture the full picture. Diversity is the result of our strength, and our strength is and always has been our freedom. It is the freedom for people to preserve and pass on their cultural traditions and the opportunity to live in peace with those around them; the freedom to live your life with equality under the law, regardless of your race or ethnic background; and the economic freedom that so many governments around the world deny their people. It is that economic freedom that ensures that hard work pays off. It gives people the ability to work towards their dreams and choose their own path in life. Together, generations of Canadians who trace their roots back to countries around the world have built Canada to truly the greatest country on earth, the true north strong and free. To ensure that our people remain free, we must continue to fight attacks on our freedoms, including racism and all forms of brutality and injustice in Canada and around the world. Minority rights must be protected. Freedom of religion must be protected. Freedom of expression and the right to peaceful protest must be protected. As John Diefenbaker said, I am a Canadian...free to speak without fear, free to worship...in my own way, free to stand for what I think right, free to oppose what I believe wrong, free to choose those who shall govern my country. This heritage of freedom I pledge to uphold for myself and all mankind. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "The hon. member for BeloeilChambly."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet (BeloeilChambly, BQ)", "content": "Thank you, Mr.Chair. George Floyd is not a victim of racism; he is another victim of racism. At a time of crisis when outrage is overwhelming the caution and fear of disease among thousands of people who, despite everything, take to the streets to express that outrage, we here in politics will have to be careful, once again, about the words we use. Indeed we are particularly inclined to give other people's words a meaning other than the one they would have liked to give them. Today, our dutyand I would say almost our only dutyis to express our solidarity, our sadness, our indignation and our anger, but above alland in saying this, I'm thinking of all my friends and acquaintances in the wonderful black community in Quebec and the UnitedStatesour friendship. We must try to be heard by all humans. Every time we talk about this, a small part of me surfaces, that of the non-practising but unrepentant anthropologist who wants to remind us that races do not exist. It is the frequency of manifestations of certain genetic traits favoured by geography and history, which in turn shape cultures. Racism expresses itself first and foremost through aggression against what is presumed to be the culture of others, difference. Each time difference instills fear, it is, of course, one time too many. We must learn to live equality in diversity, in itself an extraordinary thing. Governments in the U.S. have all been racist. Their racism has necessarily been expressed, at some point in their history, in their institutions. It has left its mark. It is the only thing that we have the right to call systemic racism or systemic discrimination. I am concerned when anyone suggests that we are all and collectively inclined to engage in systemic discrimination or when anyone claims to be a bulwark of virtue between us and the victims. I believe that the Canadian government is not racist, that the Quebec government is not racist, and that the governments of our municipalities are not racist either. I believe, however, that there may be traces of horrible things left in our institutions that colour our relationships with people of different origins or with people who were here long before us. So systemic racism probably exists. It should not denounce individuals, but it should encourage us to reread our rules to get rid of what might still be discriminatory in them. This day belongs to GeorgeFloyd. This day belongs to the black people of the UnitedStates. This day belongs to the black people of Quebec and Canada. We don't play politics at the funeral doors: we gather our thoughts, and let indignation and sadness be expressed. We leave the streets to those who need to speak with one voice, in peace. All that is peaceful is legitimate. Nothing that is violent is legitimate. The Prime Minister expressed the desire to implement concrete measures to fight racism. The first must be to show our solidarity and friendship. I'm proposing a very concrete measure, which is to give priority and expedited processing to the files of refugee claimantsespecially Haitian, especially black, but also of other originswho have expressed their desire to be part of the Quebec nation by putting themselves on the front line. He has the power and the duty to do so, and if he needs Parliament, let's do it tomorrow or right now. That way, words will become actions, and the next step will be all the more credible. In the meantime, our duty is to stand up for those who are afraid and against those who frighten them. Thank you, Mr.Chair."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "The honourable member for Burnaby South."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Jagmeet Singh (Burnaby South, NDP)", "content": "Thank you, Mr.Chair. Many, many Canadians were shocked to see the violence surrounding the murder of GeorgeFloyd. GeorgeFloyd's murder is a grim reminder that anti-black racism still exists and that it hits hard. Anti-black racism isn't only in the UnitedStates; it's here in Canada, too. Systemic racism against blacks, indigenous people and many other visible minorities is alive and well: racial profiling, economic inequality, social inequality, discriminatory hiring, trivialization of violence, excess incarceration, and so on. Things aren't moving forward because one government after another prefers pretty words to concrete action. When the time comes to act, they don't have the courage, they don't have the will to act. People are feeling a lot of grief and frustration, but we can turn that into action and justice. We must not just call for peace. I believe that we have to call for justice. Justice is the only way to create a better world.  When people around the world saw the killing of George Floyd, it left all of us shaken to our core. It was chilling, the casual violence of anti-black racism, the callous taking of another human being's life. It hurt to the core. There was pain. There was sadness. There is anger, and rightly so. There is frustration. This isn't just an American problem. This is just as much a Canadian problem as well, and something that continues to exist across our country. Anti-black racism and anti-indigenous racism are real. People have suffered violence. Indigenous people and black people have suffered violence and have been killed at the hands of police here in Canada. I think about Regis Korchinski-Paquet in Toronto and the calls for justice for Regis. A black trans woman was killed in suspicious circumstances in an interaction with the police. I think about Stewart Kevin Andrews, a young indigenous man killed in an interaction with the police in Winnipeg. The anger and frustration are about this: How many more people need to die before there's action? How many more speeches will be made? How many more protests need to happen before something is done? How many more times will people plead to breathe? How many more times will they plead to live? What we're talking about is basic human dignity. How many more voices have to ask, demand, plead, beg for basic human dignity? People are angry. They're feeling like enough is enough. Why do they need to keep on asking? Why do black people, why do indigenous people need to keep on asking to be treated like humans? Why? You know, people are done with pretty speeches, particularly pretty speeches from people in power who could do something about it right now if they wanted to. I'm standing in a hall of power, the chamber of the Commons, with a Prime Minister who has the power not just to say pretty words but to actually do something about this. The Prime Minister of this country has the power to go beyond pretty words and pretty speeches and do something. I don't have all the answers. I don't think any one person does. We're going to have to come up with those solutions together, but there are certainly some things we do know. Martin Luther King said, True peace is not merely the absence of tension; it is the presence of justice. That's what we need. We need justice.  Killer Mike extolled that people should plan, plot, strategize, organize and then mobilize. Cardi B put it this way: Another way for the people to take powerI don't want to make everything political but it is what it isis by voting. So what do we vote for? We vote for a government to take action. I call on the Prime Minister, in this hall of power: If the Prime Minister believes that black lives matter, will the Prime Minister commit to ending racial profiling in our country? If the Prime Minister believes that black lives matter, will the Prime Minister commit to ending the over-policing of black bodies? If the Prime Minister believes, truly believes, that black lives matter, will the Prime Minister commit to ending the over-incarceration of black people in this country? If the Prime Minister truly believes that black lives matter, will he commit to ensuring that there are race-based data to make better decisions? Will he commit to ensuring that there's access to education and to health resources? The Prime Minister has the power to do all these things right now. The Prime Minister simply needs to get it done. If the Prime Minister truly believes that indigenous lives matter, then similarly the Prime Minister must commit today to ending the racial profiling of indigenous people, the over-policing of indigenous people and the over-incarceration of indigenous people. If the Prime Minister truly believes that indigenous lives matter, the Prime Minister could stop taking indigenous kids to court; the Prime Minister could stop delaying the action on the calls for justice for the murdered and missing indigenous women and girls. If the Prime Minister believes that indigenous lives matter, he could ensure that there's clean drinking water and access to justice and to education and housing right now. People are angry because they are frustrated and done with pretty words. People are angry because they're done with pretty speeches from people in power who could do something about it right now. People don't want peace. They don't want an absence of tension. People want the presence of justice. People want justice. People deserve justice. People need justice, and justice is what people will get. Nothing less will do. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "The honourable member for SaanichGulf Islands"}, {"speaker": "Ms. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP)", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chair. This is indeed a difficult day. It's a difficult week. These have been difficult weeks. I stand here and want to begin by acknowledging that we are all on the traditional territory of the Algonquin peoples, and again to say meegwetch, on a day like this when we're focusing on something so painful that really is beyond partisanship and that should bind us together as people who say we cannot tolerate racism, not in this country. But we know it's here. As the Prime Minister just said, Racism never has a place in this country. But we know it's here and we know it's living with us. We are facing, in this pandemic, two dangerous, invisible viruses. One is COVID-19 and the other one we've tolerated far too long, which is race-based hatred, hate speech and anti-black racism. Yes, black lives matter. I want to do nothing but just chant it in this place until we all stand together and say, Black lives matter. What we are seeing in the murder of George Floyd is exactly as my colleague from the Bloc Qubcois said: George Floyd is not a victim of racism; he is another victim of racism. There is victim upon victim upon victim. These victims have names. We must not forget their names.  The first time a black man was killed when his last words were I can't breathe was in 2014, with Eric Garner. His mother did interviews this week. Imagine what she's going through, because George Floyd died on video also saying, I can't breathe, and the people who were stopping him from breathing, his killers, are the police. In the case of Eric Garner, the policemen were fired but never charged. In George Floyd's murder, at least one killer has been charged, but it doesn't do anything to ease the pain, nor, as my friend from the NDP said, does it quench the thirst for justice, because that's what people are crying out for. They're crying out for justice. The names just keep cascading. I had to look it up because I thought, when was it that the poor young man who was jogging was murdered by the father and son in the pickup truck? He was murdered by a retired policeman and his son in their pickup truck, in February. Breonna Taylor of Louisville was murdered in her own home by cops who thought she might have drugs there. They searched, and she didn't. What on earth allows this to keep happening over and over again?  I looked at a site called Just Security and I thought these words from reporter Mia Bloom, who happens to be Canadian, were pretty clear on what puts you at risk of death in the United States of America, but also in Canada: driving while black, jogging while black, reporting while black, bird watching while black, selling lemonade while black can get you killed. The killers far too often are wearing a uniform. I want to go back to the words reporting while black, because this is something else we've seen in the last four days that we've never seen before, which is the deliberate targeting of reporters by police. Over 100 reporters have been injured in the United States in the last four days. One woman lost her eye. These are serious injuries. Sometimes reporters get in the way of riots and whatnot, but this is different. This is another element altogether. It seems that, in this place, when we have speeches and pretty words to denounce racism, we do it in a kind of cycle. After Colten Boushie's murder, we talked about anti-indigenous racism. We talked about the threat to our indigenous brothers and sisters across this country who also face racism on a daily basis. We talked about the fact that they are disproportionately in our prisons. Just within the last day, the report came down on the killing of Dale Culver in Prince George at the hands of the Prince George RCMP. This indigenous young man was 35 years old, and he was pepper-sprayed until he couldn't breathe. There will be charges in this case. That's the recommendation that just came down. We go through sequential moments where we can say Islamophobia is not okay. Six Muslims at prayer in Quebec City were murdered. We can all stand up and say we denounce Islamophobia. Or we can denounce anti-trans violence against individual trans people who are murdered.  We denounce anti-Semitism when we see anti-Semitic graffiti scrawled on the door of an Ottawa rabbi's home. We denounce it, but can we get to the root of it? As the honourable leader of the Conservative Party mentioned, in recent days we're seeing anti-Asian racism on the increase. We're seeing all this happen and we want to be good allies. We want to be a good ally to the family of Regis Korchinski-Paquet. We want to be a good ally. I am a woman of privilege. I got it by mere random accident of birth. I was born to white parents. Privilege is being white. We have to study our privilege. We have to acknowledge our privilege and we have to know, as the Prime Minister said, we're not perfect, but it doesn't give us a free pass to ignore that we have to stand up and we have to speak out. I am sitting so close to my friend here, our minister, Ahmed HussenI say your name out loud, but your tweets brought me to tearsthat this fine man faces racism in his own riding, that his three beautiful black boys have people turn away or clutch their purse or they're a little worried when the kids are around. It sounds exactly like what the Prime Minister just called the microaggressions that many of us might not even see. We can look at our own conduct and our own behaviour. In looking at these things, there is something I want to say, when we look at all these things that are happening and we wonder, what we can do about it. When we see a bully, when we hear hate speech, we have to speak up. We have to speak out and we have to say that the President of the United States is fomenting hatred and violence and it's shameful and shocking that he would grab a Bible, then use tear gas to clear peaceful protestors on a Washington street so that Donald Trump could pose with a Bible in front of an Episcopal church. The Episcopal Bishop of Washington had this to say, because she is a good ally:     In no way do we support the President's incendiary response to a wounded, grieving nation. In faithfulness to our Saviour who lived a life of non-violence and sacrificial love, we align ourselves with those seeking justice for the death of George Floyd.   That's what we must do in this place. We must acknowledge and speak up for justice for the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls, the report on which languishes a year later. We must stand up for justice and we must examine something very worrying. In 2006, the U.S. FBI warned that white supremacist groups were targeting police forces and joining them. If we're looking for real action, things we can do in this place, I call on us to have an inquiry and an examination to root out white supremacist groups in Canada and identify them for what they are, a terrorist threat in our midst. We must make sure they're not in our police forces, because if there is one thing scarier than a white supremacist with a gun, it's a white supremacist with a gun in uniform. Please, God, there are things we can do. Please, God, we love each other, take care of each other regardless of the colour of our skin, and pray for the United States of America. It's a country being ripped apart, and the ripping and the tearing is being done by people who should at this very time be consoling and leading and inspiring. Pray. Pray for Canada. Pray for each and every one of our beautiful black baby girls and boys, the indigenous baby girls and boys, the Asian kids. Wherever you look, reach out and be a good ally. Stand up and say, With my body I get between you and the cops. We have to be good allies. Right now, they're just pretty words.

They have weakened the ability to protect our borders.

If it were up to the Prime Minister, he would not have to answer to anyone. That is not how democracy works. We in the opposition have been long calling for the return of Parliament, which would be possible while still maintaining public health guidelines. Canadians deserve to be represented in the House of Commons by the elected member of Parliament. While the work we do in our constituencies is incredibly important, it is equally important to bring those voices back to Ottawa to debate, to question and to hold the government to account. This is fundamental to the role of an elected representative. The role of the opposition is crucial now more than ever when billions of dollars are being spent with little oversight. Our role as members of Parliament is to uphold our democracy and to be present. This is the greatest pandemic in our lifetime. Now is not the time to hide behind a podium.

This is just a small sample of the many individuals and organizations that have stepped up across Canada.  Khalsa Aid has been providing food supplies with the help of Sperenza Banquet Hall, which has graciously provided the space to run a province-wide campaign out of Brampton East. Care4Cause has sent hundreds of prepared meals on a weekly basis to Good Shepherd Ministries to lessen their load. Navraj Brar at Pharmasave has offered free care packages to health care workers and hand sanitizer to the Peel Regional Police. Aujla Salon and Spa has partnered with GlobalMedic to help deliver over 10,000 pounds of food to local food banks. I would also like to point out the heroic efforts of our truck drivers, taxi drivers, grocery store clerks, nurses, doctors, paramedics and countless other front-line heroes. We see you and we are immensely grateful for the bravery you display each and every day. Thank you to everyone in Brampton East who has stepped up for their neighbour in their time of need.

It's a committee where only statements, petitions and questions are allowed. There is no power to introduce motions, to test confidence or to vote. The government came to office promising greater democracy but they broke their promise on electoral reform. They tried to give the PMO the control over this House in motion 6, and yesterday's report confirms that they rigged the leaders debate in their favour in the last election. Now they've shuttered Parliament. Parliament sat through two world wars, the October crisis and previous pandemics and it survived the test, but not now. The people's representatives need to sit.

The pandemic has taken its toll on so many. It is in these times of suffering and adversity that we have seen Canadians coming together to support each other and that brings us hope. Mosques, churches, synagogues and gurdwaras have all answered the call to help their communities. Whether it's providing meals to the hungry, clothing for the cold, or technology for those who need it most, these actions are true reflections of the kindness and generosity that Canadians are known for. While there are too many groups to mention them all, I want to thank Vikas Sharma and Care4Cause out of Brampton for the meals that they have been providing their community in that area and across the GTA.

Even today we continue to observe this reality in my very own city where we witnessed the killing of three indigenous youth by police in a span of 10 days this past April. This is not a coincidence. We have statistics. We have research, and we have stories of loved ones lost. We know it, and we see it in our lives every day. We need to address police violence throughout this country.

It has been left behind where others have made millions of dollars. Its platform isn't effective. It's now delivering more parcels, but it's losing money. There's a statement to make here, right now. In the immediate term, Canada Post must deal with the delays, and to do so, it needs the help of the Government of Canada. Canada Post needs to hire staff. If a collective agreement had finally been signed, it would make it easier to hire staff. We have been waiting for two and a half years. A premium for essential workers might also be appropriate.

It is a rude blow to hard-working professionals who soldier past negligent government policies that have left a stain on another generation of western Canadians. We're talking about an industry here that directly employs over 200,000, including 11,000 indigenous Canadians. We're talking about an industry that contributes 75% of Canada's investment in clean technology. However, Canada's resource industry will still be resilient.

We have been meeting by Zoom for some time now. Why was that not able to be an option?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau", "content": "Mr.Chair, I meet with my provincial colleagues every week, either by conference call or by Zoom. I can assure my colleague about our ongoing collaboration with the provinces. As for the AgriRecovery program, once again, the provinces have to implement it and it is their choice to contribute their share of 40% or not, in whole or in part. However, our federal commitment on the 60% share is firm."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Richard Lehoux", "content": "Mr.Chair, if I understand correctly, there will be no changes to the various programs before November. The sectors of agriculture under supply management, like eggs and poultry producers in my constituency, who have been promised compensation for a long time, want to know when the money will be transferred to the producers who are working tirelessly to feed our country."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau", "content": "I know that poultry, egg and milk producers work extremely hard. Our commitment to them in terms of compensation in response to the three free-trade agreements is still firm. At the moment, we are concentrating on emergency programs. We will then proceed with that compensation."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "Mr.Lehoux, you have about 30seconds left."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Richard Lehoux", "content": "Thank you, Mr.Chair. As I see it, I still have not had an answer. The country is moving towards more automation. I am thinking, for example, about the advances that many SMEs and farmers in my constituency could implement in their companies. Unfortunately, in the regions, the Internet is far from adequate. When will I be able to tell my constituents that reliable Internet service will be available in their homes?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau", "content": "I assure you that we recognize the importance of the Internet in rural regions. I myself represent a rural constituency and it is a challenge every day. We are working with our colleagues, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry and the Minister of Rural Economic Development to speed up the implementation of programs along those lines."}, {"speaker": "The Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.))", "content": "We'll now proceed to Mr. Motz."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Glen Motz", "content": "Mr. Chair, for the Minister of Public Safety, Minister Blair, how many times has the list of banned firearms changed since May 1?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)", "content": "My understanding is that an order in council was made on May 1, and we have not made any changes to that order in council."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Glen Motz", "content": "That's untrue. How many more firearms have been added to the original prohibited list since that date?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "I suspect the member may be referring to the work that the RCMP has been doing through the Canadian firearms program in order to apply the order in council that was passed."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Before we go to Mr. Motz, I want to ask all honourable members to ensure that they are on mute. We are getting some voices in the background. Mr. Motz, please continue."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Glen Motz", "content": "How many .22 calibre rifles, firearms, are on that banned list?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "To be very clear, Mr. Chair, the banned list includes a number of assault-style rifles, including the AR-15. The member may be referring to a weapon that the RCMP has identified as using an AR-15 frame, which of course"}, {"speaker": "Mr. Glen Motz", "content": "Again, that is a wrong answer, Mr. Chair. How many shotguns are now on that banned list?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "That is a bit of confusion put out by the gun lobby to frighten hunters. In fact, we did not prohibit any shotguns."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Glen Motz", "content": "Again, that is another untruth, Mr. Chair. Are there any airsoft guns on the prohibited list?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "That's another bit of mistruth and deception put out by the gun lobby. In fact, there was a weapon called the Blackwater AR-15, which was a real gun that was prohibited, but the toy gun, the airsoft one, was not."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Glen Motz", "content": "That's untrue. I know some of those exact firearms that are on that list. Why is the RCMP continuing to add firearms to the prohibited list after the list was published?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Mr. Chair, it is a very important that the RCMP, as the agency responsible for administering the Canadian firearms program, continues to do its diligence to keep Canadians safe."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Glen Motz", "content": "Why has there been no notice given to firearms owners, retailers or the police of the many changes to the banned firearms list?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Again, Mr. Chair, it is very important that the Canadian firearms program and the RCMP continue to do the important work of ensuring that Canadians are kept safe."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Glen Motz", "content": "How many firearms have been transferred between licensed gun owners and/or retailers since May 1?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Again, I do not have that information and, as the member probably knows, records are not kept by the government or by law enforcement about the transfer of firearms that are not restricted."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Glen Motz", "content": "How many firearms have been retroactively changed to prohibited since May 1? Of the firearms that have been transferred, how many now are retroactively prohibited since May 1?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Mr. Chair, to be very clear, on May 1, by order in council, we prohibited 1,500 somewhat different types of firearms, all based upon a military design. Those are the weapons that are prohibited."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Glen Motz", "content": "Since that time you have added almost 700 more, and none of those meet that category you are trying to establish. If a firearm that was not on the original prohibited list was transferred since May 1 and now that firearm appears on that prohibited list, are those transfers subject to a criminal prosecution?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Again, the member is asking me a question that is solely the responsibility of the law enforcement agency of jurisdiction, and that is their decision, not ours."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Glen Motz", "content": "The minister has said that the issuance of firearm licences and transfers was stopped recently due to a printer failure. We now know that to be completely false. There was no such failure, but an ordered shutdown. Who ordered the RCMP to withhold these services from law-abiding Canadians?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "I have absolutely no knowledge of the allegation the member has just made, Mr. Chair, and so I cannot really confirm or deny that it actually ever happened."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Glen Motz", "content": "Maybe the minister needs to check with his officials and find out who actually did the ordering. What does the minister believe to be the estimated cost of the firearms confiscation plan?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Mr. Chair, there was no firearms confiscation plan. We will, however, be bringing legislation forward at the very first opportunity to facilitate a buyback program that will treat Canadians who purchased these firearms fairly."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Glen Motz", "content": "You can't buy back something that you never owned in the first place, Mr. Chair. These costs must include administration, price per firearm, as well as the industry costs. We know that industry costs are over $1 billion. If this minister doesn't know the cost, maybe he's as incompetent as our Minister of Finance. I am wondering, Chair, through you, why the law enforcement notes were removed from the firearms reference table?"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "I want to remind the honourable members that parliamentary language is something we need to respect in the House. We should be careful what we say. The honourable minister may reply."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I'd just like to advise you and this House that our purpose is to protect the lives of Canadians, and we are taking strong action to strengthen gun control. We are not influenced by the gun lobby or by gun manufacturers, only by our interest in keeping Canadians safe."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We will now continue to Mr. Duncan."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Eric Duncan (StormontDundasSouth Glengarry, CPC)", "content": "Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I want to start by thanking the government for listening to my proposals a couple of weeks ago regarding the extension of benefits for vulnerable Canadians who may not have been able to file their income tax by this week's deadline. There are millions of relieved seniors with GIS and parents with the child tax benefit and GST who now know they have a bit of time and protection and aren't to be cut off from their benefits. I'm hoping to go two for two here today, so there's no pressure to the Minister of Public Safety. I want to build on the comments last week from Ms. Gladu, my colleague from SarniaLambton, about family reunification between Canadians and Americans. Many constituents in my riding are concerned and are caught in this situation. I certainly support, and I think we support in this chamber, the idea of the extension for travel. However, it's now been three months since many spouses have seen each other, and there are Canadian and American children in custody arrangements who have seen their parent only on one side of the border or the other. After stating for months that reunifying families wasn't considered essential travel, I am thankful that he and the Prime Minister have now said that it is. Will the minister agree to the safe and fair proposal we outlined in our letter last week, which would exempt spouses, children and those with medical needs travelling back and forth with accompanying documentation, so that we can get people and their families back together?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "I'd like to thank the member for what I think is a very important question and I want to assure him that I have had similar conversations with members of this House from all parties and representing all parts of the country. We recognize the challenge that this particular policy of restricting non-essential travel has meant for families. It is not our intention and never will be our intention to separate families. We are working very closely with the CBSA to ensure that individuals are treated fairly. I want to share this with the member and honourable members of this House. Any change we make to our arrangement at the border will require a change by an order in council. Because there is a great deal of concern in our communities and from our provincial and territorial partners about the movement of people across our border, any change has to be discussed and negotiated with our provincial partners. Some of them, you may be aware, have expressed some concern, and we're addressing those concerns because we respect their concerns. At the same time we are working very hard, and I am very hopeful that we'll be able to resolve this challenge to the satisfaction of the many Canadians you and everyone else represents."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "I want to remind the honourable members that when they are asking or answering a question, they should speak through the Chair and not directly to the other member. We will go back to Mr. Duncan."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Eric Duncan", "content": "We were looking at each other. It's a bad habit. To the minister, I appreciate the comments. I will just note that the Canadian and American governments have worked with provinces, as we have with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to repatriate Canadians from around the world. There have been quarantine protocols put in place to allow that. There are protocols and there is a precedence. I am just wondering why there is a delay in acknowledging the families part. I believe there is a precedent and I believe there is a background there, and I think we can, through an order in council or whatever measure, get people back with their families. Can the minister explain why reunifying families needs to be any different from repatriating Canadians from other countries?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Again I thank the member, because this is a very important issue and it's important to us as well. We have been working over the past couple of weeks very diligently on trying to find a resolution of this problem, because it is never our intention to separate families and we have all heard some very heart-wrenching concerns that have been raised. At the same time, I think it's important to work very closely, as we have done, with our provincial and territorial partners to ensure that we address the concerns they have raised. We are prepared to move forward and we are working very hard to resolve the concerns that were raised so that we can have a positive answer to those many families, and we"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We will go back to Mr. Duncan."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Eric Duncan", "content": "I appreciate that comment from the minister. I want to share the story of a constituent of mine, Mr. David Lee, from Cornwall. He and his wife Maria have been married for a couple of years now. She is an American citizen. They spend about five months of the year in Texas and five months in Cornwall and would generally travel about two months of the year. However, she couldn't come up to Canada because of the restrictions that have been put in place, and it's certainly putting a strain on them. Can the minister confirm that the three concerns we outlined in our letter are being discussed as part of reaching a solution or a resolution as soon as possible? The three concerns are that spouses and long-term partners can be reunited, that children with child custody arrangements can see both of their parents, and that if somebody needs to travel back or forth over the border for medical appointments, they can do that and can stay with their spouse. Can you confirm that all three are on the table and will be addressed?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "What I can confirm is that we're working hard to make sure we keep families together. I want to reiterate, because you raise a very important point, that when people cross the border they're still subject to the quarantine orders of public health. That's for the protection of all Canadians. You mentioned travelling back and forth across the border. If the travel is deemed essential, that is an exception, but if it is not deemed essential, then a person must go into quarantine for 14 days. That's one of the concerns the provinces have raised with us and one of the assurances they have sought. We're working to provide those assurances."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Before we go to the next line of questioning, I want to remind the honourable members that we have interpreters who are working very hard to translate from one language to the other. I therefore ask you to speak a little more slowly out of consideration for the interpreters, who are doing a really good job. We'll now go to Mr. Kram."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Michael Kram (ReginaWascana, CPC)", "content": "Mr. Chair, I've had the opportunity to talk with Mr. James Bogusz, CEO of the Regina Airport Authority, and he paints a grim picture. He expects the airport to be out of money by the end of the summer. The loss of the Regina International Airport would be devastating, not only to the city of Regina but also to southern Saskatchewan. The Liberal government has made a great show out of allegedly providing $330 million in assistance to airports through lease deferrals, but here is what it's not telling people: Airport lease payments are already tied to revenue and have been for many years, so when an airport's revenue goes down to zero, its lease payments to the federal government go down to zero, pandemic or no pandemic. That means the government has done absolutely nothing to help Canada's airports. Will the government commit today to providing real assistance to Canada's struggling airports?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "The Minister of Transport has been working very closely with airports, large and small, right across the country. We have continued to update our responses in this rapidly evolving situation. We've been in touch with each of the airports, and we've been working very hard to help them manage through these difficult times. We know that in some circumstances, continued operations at smaller airports have not been possible, but wherever possible we have done our very best to try to accommodate the very real financial challenges these airports are experiencing."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Michael Kram", "content": "Mr. Chair, Canada's airports are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy and the Liberal government's response has been to defer their lease payments. These were already based on revenue, so these deferrals are effectively meaningless. In the meantime, the U.S. government's CARES program is providing $10 billion in grants and low-interest forgivable loans to support American airports. Will the government commit today to saving Canada's airports with a similar program of grants and forgivable loans?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Mr. Chair, we have worked very hard, and continue to do so, to make sure we provide supports to regional airports right across this country. We know how important air transport is to such a vast country and we know the tremendous work they do. They support communities and the Canadian economy. We're going to work very closely with them to make sure we provide the right supports to help them get through this difficult time, because we know how important they will be to the eventual restart of our economy. Their continued existence and success are important to that restart, and we'll work with them."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Michael Kram", "content": "Mr. Chair, the airport crisis goes far beyond my home city of Regina. Airports are vital to Canada's economy, providing over 200,000 jobs nationwide and paying $13 billion in wages and $7 billion in taxes. However, now Canada's airports are on the brink of collapse, and the government has stood idly by as airports have lost over 90% of their revenue. Last month Joyce Carter, chair of the Canadian Airports Council, called on the government for a three-point plan for airport recovery. It includes the permanent elimination of ground leases, substantive loan and bond guarantees and a special plan to support smaller airports that provide vital supplies to rural and remote communities. Could the minister inform the committee if the government has done anything in response to the Canadian Airports Council's request?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "I would make the observation that all of our smaller regional airports are vital to the communities they serve. That's why it's important that we work with them all. The Minister of Transport is in regular communication and in ongoing discussions with airport authorities, large and small, right across this country on how we can continue to support them. There have been a number of proposals made by the industry itself and by some of the regional airports on what form that help can take. That's all part of a very important ongoing discussion. I believe it is clear that Canadians need our help, and we are there for Canadians to help them get back on their feet when we get through this pandemic."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Mr. Kram, we have time for a 15-second question and a 15-second answer."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Michael Kram", "content": "Mr. Chair, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Japan have all started free trade negotiations with the United Kingdom.

Some hon. members: Oh, oh!"}, {"speaker": "Mr. Alain Therrien", "content": "Mr.Chair, I know that they think its funny to pilfer taxpayers money from government coffers. But that is not our style.

Bill Morneau", "content": "I do not know how many people work for the Liberal Party, but I can say that the emergency wage subsidy is for all sectors of the economy.

It is very important for them and for our economy."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Alain Therrien", "content": "Let's use a round number. Let's say 100employees.

This is important for them and, of course, very important for our economy."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Alain Therrien", "content": "Mr.Chair, since I am not getting an answer, let me share with you the very simple calculation I cobbled together. One hundred employees at $847 a week is $340,000a month. That is the amount of taxpayers' money that the Liberal Party is putting into its pockets. If we multiply that amount by threethat's three months, since it started on March15we get over $1million. That is the amount they will have put in their pockets, to be used as election loot for the Liberal Party. Given that the Liberals are extending the emergency wage subsidy, will their party continue to help itself to the money?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "The purpose of the emergency wage subsidy is to protect employees. So every business must ensure that the money goes to the employees. That is very important.

Mr. Chair, as parliamentarians, our greatest responsibility is to keep Canadians safe. During the previous Parliament, our government made significant investments in the CBSA and the RCMP, and provided funds to provinces and territories to invest in programs that combat gun and gang violence and support our communities in providing positive alternatives for youth engagement and activities. On May 1, our government banned assault-style weapons. This is something that we pledged to do during the last federal election and something that victims' groups, law enforcement and everyday Canadians called on for decades, but we must know that we need to take more action to keep our communities safe. Mr. Chair, I'm sure that this continues to be an important issue for many communities. Can the minister tell the House and the constituents of NewmarketAurora what further steps our government will take to keep Canadians safe?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Mr. Chair, I'd like to begin by thanking the honourable member for NewmarketAurora for his question and for his advocacy on behalf of the safety of his community. Mr. Chair, building upon historic investments that we made in the last Parliament in law enforcement dealing with guns and gangs, we took the important next step in our promise to strengthen Canada's gun control by prohibiting weapons that many in the law enforcement community, including the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police, have said have no place in our communities. There is much more to do. We will build on these early steps by strengthening our work and our laws at the border, by taking steps to prevent the theft and criminal diversion of guns and also by making significant investments in kids, families and communities where the conditions give rise to gun violence right across Canada.

Mr. Chair, in cities and towns across Canada, small businesses are the backbones of our local economies. They are also pillars of our communities. Even during these challenging times, we have seen restaurants and other businesses step up to deliver meals to front-line workers and make donations to our local food banks. So many have supported Scarborough Health Network's meals on wheels program. Their leadership has been inspiring. I have heard from many small business owners in Scarborough, from dentists to small manufacturers, who are having trouble paying their commercial rents due to the sharp downturn in business caused by COVID-19. They are interested in how programs like the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance program would help them to stay in business, but they worry that these programs may not be able to help if their landlords don't participate. These small businesses are crucial to our community. Could the Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade please explain why it is so important that the landlords participate to help small businesses make it through the pandemic and how we are working to make this program a success, not just here in Scarborough but across Canada?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Mary Ng", "content": "Mr. Chair, I want to thank the member of Parliament for her advocacy for the people of Scarborough Centre on this really important question. While rent is an area of provincial responsibility, helping businesses across the country is all of our responsibility. This is why we have stepped up to provide rent relief to businesses while, at the same time, helping property owners maintain the rental income through this crisis. We are asking property owners to do their part in keeping small businesses and their employees to get through these challenging times, and to take advantage of our forgivable loans in order to help small businesses that are the hardest hit by reducing their rent by 75%. This is a win-win situation. Many landlords have already stepped up, and we salute their efforts.

Can the minister tell us how many families have actually received this housing support?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Ahmed Hussen (Minister of Families, Children and Social Development)", "content": "Mr. Chair, I want to thank the honourable member for asking about this really special and unique housing benefit.

Only one province has signed on, and there has been no national consultation on how such a benefit program would even be implemented. With so little federal leadership, the Canadian Alliance of Non-Profit Housing Associations has stepped up and done the work for the government. They have outlined five key principles to guide the implementation of the Canada housing benefit. Will the minister adopt those principles and get on with ensuring vulnerable families get the rental assistance they need?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Ahmed Hussen", "content": "Mr. Chair, it is really unfortunate that the honourable member thinks that an investment of $55 billion and the commitment of a 10-year federal plan of leadership in affordable housing and community housing is a lack of leadership. It is quite the opposite. The Canada housing benefit is yet another important segment of the national housing strategy, which will ensure people have access to a safe, affordable place to call home. It is being signed by a number of provinces, not just one as the honourable member suggests. There are up to five provinces that have moved on signing on to the Canada housing benefit."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Jenny Kwan", "content": "Then surely the minister can actually tell us how many families benefited from that program. The fact is that two and a half million families are paying more than 30% of their income on rent, and they have been hit hard by this pandemic. Reciting the same message box over and over again will not get them the help they need. Aside from going forward with a housing benefit program, will the government prioritize affordable housing stimulus spending as a key component of any post-COVID stimulus policy?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Ahmed Hussen", "content": "Mr. Chair, joining with provinces and territories and providing real help to members of the community who are experiencing homelessness so they can have a permanent roof over their heads is real action. It's real leadership by our government as part of the Canada housing benefit. This is a real benefit that is going to households in core housing need, people who experience a core housing need and who need a permanent place to call home.

The nuance and sophistication of the EI system was not available to us. As a result, as I said, eight million Canadians are getting the CERB.

We do not want to put anybody in a more difficult situation."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie", "content": "Mr.Chair, the truth is that the government has forgotten the thousands of workers covered under a supplementary unemployment benefit agreement.

We're working with employers to make sure that their workers have this benefit, regardless of whether or not the CERB is in place.

Agreements were signed before March15 for subsequent periods, but there was an agreement with Service Canada. Companies have tried to contact Service Canada by telephone, but no one is answering. They have tried by email, but no one is replying either. The companies have decided to honour their part of the contract and pay out the SUB. However, the government says that, after the fact, it changed the rules that had previously applied, and it is no longer honouring its agreement. As I understand it, the government does not want to straighten out the situation, and that is unacceptable."}, {"speaker": "Hon.

The group discussed some current problems caused by Brexit, and the efforts they have made for current and future risks, on discussing the Brexit's impact on program Eramus and international mobility. Finally, the group discussed the financial funding barriers and future financial forecast for Wales' higher education system."}], "specific_query_list": [{"query": "What did Dr. David Blaney think of the impact of Brexit on the capacity of Wales' higher education system?", "answer": "First, the economic impact of Brexit is shown in a number of ways, like the extent to which the HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the EU. We can also see some changes in students' applications and in increasing difficulties of the EU collaborative research activities. In terms of the financial impact, if it is accepted that the UK is a net contributor to the EU then, presumably, some of Wales' money will go straight into politics, and the benefits are unknown, which will become a matter of politics. In terms of recruitment, both European Union-domiciled applicants to Wales and non-EU international students decreased, who applied to Welsh institutions. While the number for both groups of students who apply to English universities increased.", "relevant_text_span": [["8", "10"]]}, {"query": "Summarize the main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector at the moment.", "answer": "The funding position would be the main pressure. The recommendations for re-establishing funding at Welsh institutions are expected to take quite a bit longer.  Wales institutions are still funding at a lower level. Then, as for enrollments, there is also the start of a reduction, both in Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to Wales. And finally, the uncertainty about potential consequences that could arise from the review in England of fees and funding\u2014the Augar review.", "relevant_text_span": [["11", "15"]]}, {"query": "According to Dr. Blaney, what are the reasons for the drop in EU students applying to study in Wales?", "answer": "He thinks there may be two reasons.  The first one is about the change in student support arrangements for EU students, which will have an effect of perturbation. Wales' institutions' fee level is slightly lower, but they do struggle in terms of the Anglocentric nature of the media and so on. The other dimension is about the attractiveness of the higher institutions in a highly competitive recruitment market. Wales universities don't have enough investment in facilities, and particularly buildings and kits.", "relevant_text_span": [["16", "20"]]}, {"query": "What does Dr. Blaney think of the reasons why prospective students should study in Wales?", "answer": "One of the reasons  is relative safety, Wales is a comfortable and safe place to be. Then, being part of a UK system is also an important message there as well. Students enjoy a UK-quality system, a UK degree, and the strength of that brand is available in Wales, and they can be safer and more supportive in Wales.", "relevant_text_span": [["42", "44"]]}, {"query": "Summarize the efforts of assessments on the future of the institutions.", "answer": "According to Mr. Blaney, there's a Welsh Government HE Brexit working group, providing early summaries of the risks and the potential impact, in terms of the exposure of the sector to EU-sourced funding. Beyond that, the working group will also share the work that institutions are doing individually to look at how they would respond to different scenarios, which hasn't been implemented yet.", "relevant_text_span": [["68", "76"]]}, {"query": "How Brexit might impact the fee and access plans of the higher institutions?", "answer": "According to Mr. Blaney, there are two dimensions. Fee and access plans are approved annually by Mr. Blaney's group. They go through their financial sustainability, which is based on their forecasts and data. And also, the fee plans themselves make assumptions about how many students of different types are going to be recruited. Unless the institutions can find other students, and they will reduce the amount of investment in the various activities that are identified in the fee plans.", "relevant_text_span": [["72", "73"]]}, {"query": "Other than fee and access reports, what else do executives do to assure that Welsh higher education institutions are effectively planning for Brexit?", "answer": "They touched on contingency plans, which also focus on promotion and look for additional or increased sources of funding, and touched on strengthening the Global Wales engagement in order to sell Wales. The other sector that they worked on  is the funding of infrastructure. So they worked with UK universities to make arguments at UK Government level.", "relevant_text_span": [["77", "80"]]}, {"query": "According to the group, are higher education institutions having enough preparations on expertises to react to the current situation?", "answer": "Bethan Owen thinks that they can advise based on visible data and information and on their judgment. The big thing in this whole Brexit scenario contains so much uncertainty. And according to Dr David Blaney, they have varied links into institutions, having lots of conversations, getting information for the assessment about the financial sustainability of the institutions, assessing governance and management levels and foreseeing challenges.", "relevant_text_span": [["81", "83"]]}, {"query": "What do the group think of the existing problem of Erasmus and the mobility funding for students?", "answer": "According to Bethan Owen, seven of the universities are referring to mobility, so they are including an element of it from their own income and fee and access income. However, Erasmus is such a well-established and long-term plan that to implement anything similar to it would be much less efficient and much more costly, so  replacing it would be a challenge.", "relevant_text_span": [["85", "87"]]}, {"query": "What does the executives do to protect students' interests as the Brexit scenario evolves?", "answer": "They were the first of the funding councils in the UK to have a memorandum of understanding with the National Union of Students in Wales, ahead of the rest of the UK in requiring all HE providers to have student charters and there are elements of student protection within the student charter. They're also requiring further education institutions who are regulated and deliver higher education to do similar or the same, and that's very important.", "relevant_text_span": [["91", "92"]]}, {"query": "What are the other barriers to Welsh universities gaining more funding from UK research councils?", "answer": "The biggest is that there's an issue about investment. The quality of the research base in Welsh universities and the productivity of that Welsh research base are both good, there's just not enough of them. If they want to be able to play into the UK-wide research funding, the investment has two dimensions. One is having enough researchers playing in larger projects rather than small-scale projects; and the second thing is that, compared to UK-wide research pots, Wales' core research funding is not competitive. Also,  the Welsh sector has not been sufficiently focused on getting in on the conversations with the research councils.", "relevant_text_span": [["95", "96"]]}, {"query": "What are the potential difficulties after Brexit for the continuation and enhancement of researcher collaborations and networks?", "answer": "First of all, whether the Brexit deal might impact adversely on the capacity of the collaborations is still unknown. But we've mentioned playing into Horizon Europe, and being able to continue with that would be an important part of that capacity. Wales should maintain the quality, maintain the impact, and hopefully grow the critical mass. Dr David Blaney thinks that they are already showing dividends in terms of the capacity to win more research funding, and to establish an even stronger presence in the international research market.", "relevant_text_span": [["117", "119"]]}], "meeting_transcripts": [{"speaker": "Gareth Rogers", "content": "Good morning, and welcome to today's meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee.

No. We will move on then to item 2, and our inquiry into the impact of Brexit on higher and further education, and our first evidence session. I'm very pleased to welcome the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales here today, and Dr David Blaney as chief executive, and Bethan Owen, director of institutional engagement. Welcome to you both. Thanks for coming along to give evidence today. If it's okay with you, we'll move straight to questions, and Julie Morgan."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Good morning. Bore da. I wondered if we could start off with you telling us what evidence you can see that the Brexit process has had any impact on Welsh higher education so far."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Can I preface the response by just reminding you that we are, by contract and by role, apolitical, and a lot of the judgments about the impact of Brexit essentially reflect where people sit politically in terms of whether they think it's a good thing or a bad thing? We're not going to go there, obviously, today, so we'll stick to the facts as we can see them, and hopefully we'll be able to help you, but there are areas where we are unable to help. That's part of the reason."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "We certainly do not expect you to enter the political fray in any way."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Thank you. But even in terms of your assessment of whether this is going to be a good thing or a bad thing, a good impact or a bad impact, some of that inevitably in the end becomes a matter of your politics on it, so we will be as careful as we can be on that. In terms of the impact of Brexit on higher education, clearly, the significance here is about the contribution that higher education can make to Wales. So, we fund provision; we don't fund providers, technically, although obviously there's not much provision without providers. So, we are interested in the sustainability of higher education providers, but fundamentally the issue is: what does the HE system in Wales do for Wales, and what impact might Brexit have on the capacity of the system to continue to deliver for Wales? So, we know that universities make annually about \u00a35 billion of impact; 50,000 jobs. Of course, in Wales, all of that economic impact is really very significant, and uncertainty about the relationships and the arrangements with Europe is one of the most significant issues confronting university management at the moment. That has an impact in a number of ways. We can identify at the moment the extent to which the HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the EU, so EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding, and so on, from the EU. We can identify some of that, but, actually, what happens in the future is much harder to be clear about. We are beginning to see some impact in terms of applications from EU students and I'll ask Bethan to share some details on that in a moment. We're also beginning to pick up, only anecdotally, some signs that there are increasing difficulties in the UK sector, and the Welsh sector as part of that, in playing in some of the EU collaborative research activities. And that, I think, just reflects the extent to which EU partners consider that British partners might be a stable partner as we go through this transition period. We don't have data on that\u2014that's anecdotal\u2014but there are signs that some of those relationships are beginning to become a little bit more difficult. In terms of the financial impact of that, clearly, if it is accepted that the UK is a net contributor to the EU then, presumably, some of the money\u2014we're almost immediately straight into politics if you're not careful\u2014but some of the money will be available back to the UK, and the extent to which Wales benefits or not from that returned money is a function of the political relationship between the Welsh Government and Her Majesty's Government. It's not necessarily the case that Wales will always lose out in that relationship, but that will become a matter of politics. There's a broader dimension, which is about the economic impact of Brexit on the UK economy and how much tax revenue there is and all of that. I think it's very hard for us to be definitive about how that's going to play out. I think that depends on the deal and how it all unfolds over the next several years. But we can certainly anticipate some turbulence and exactly how that plays for institutions remains to be seen.\u00a0We can touch later on on the extent to which they are sighted on\u00a0this and preparing for it. So, in terms of recruitment, Bethan."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "This is based on the UCAS\u00a0applications and the report that was published at the end of June, 30 June.\u00a0The European Union-domiciled applicants to Wales have decreased by 8\u00a0per cent, which contrasts with a 2\u00a0per cent increase for English institutions, and non-EU\u2014so international students, not from Europe\u2014have also decreased by 9\u00a0per cent to Welsh institutions, again contrasting with a 7\u00a0per cent increase in England. So, those are the signs of changes."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Could I then just ask you what you see as the main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector at the moment?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "The funding position would be the main pressure. The recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond in his review of higher education funding and student finance are in the process of being implemented, and the changes to the student finance arrangements will take effect from this September. However, the recommendations for re-establishing funding at Welsh institutions are expected to take quite a bit longer. That funding, when it returns to institutions, is intended to re-establish funding for higher cost provision, both full time and part time; reinstate funding for innovation; and maintain, at the very least, the research funding in real terms. Universities, in the meantime,\u00a0are trying to minimise the cost reductions that they're making in order to maintain the infrastructure, so that when the funding comes they can get the best value out of it. We have announced our funding allocations for 2018-19. For the research and teaching grant, though, we are still funding at a lower level\u2014\u00a312.5 million less\u2014then the starting point for the Diamond report, the 2015-16 starting report.\u00a0But we expect to be able to start introducing funding from 2019-20 to make a start on implementing Diamond. And it's probably important to note that the Diamond recommendations predated Brexit, therefore the challenges introduced by Brexit are in addition to those that the Diamond report was addressing. The other pressures relate to student recruitment. I mentioned the EU and international students. There is also the start of a reduction, both in Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to Wales. Enrolments are obviously the key important number, which we'll see later. And the other pressures include pay and pension costs, not least the issues around the universities superannuation scheme pension fund, where there's potentially a significant increase in cost. Increased student expectations for modern facilities and infrastructure bring a requirement for capital expenditure and borrowing, which bring their own pressures. And finally, the uncertainty about potential consequences that could arise from the review in England of fees and funding\u2014the Augar review."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "In terms of European Union students and enrolment, is Wales forecast to do less well than England and, if so, why might that be?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "They are not forecasting it. It's very difficult until the enrolments are made, and it's also very hard to see\u2014the data that we see is the UCAS\u00a0data. Institutions also recruit directly, so until we see the actual recruitment\u2014. I think the arrangements that have changed from 2018-19 also impact on EU students. So, now, they have to find the full fee, whereas previously they were getting the grant in the same way as\u00a0Welsh students. So, I'm speculating that that might be having an impact as well on EU students' appetite to come."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. First of all Llyr, then Mark."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Well, that's straight into what I was going to ask, really, about what you think the factors are that led to this 8 per cent or 9 per cent drop in EU students applying to study in Wales, where we see a 2 per cent increase in England. Is that it, or are there other things that you've taken into account? What's your assessment of the reasons behind this?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "It's very difficult to be definitive about the reasons, but I think there are probably two. The one that Bethan has already indicated, which is the change in student support arrangements for EU students, will have\u00a0an effect of perturbation.\u00a0That's probably relatively temporary\u2014let's hope it is\u2014as that settles down because, actually, the deal for EU students coming into Wales is no worse than that coming into England. Ours would be better because the fee level is slightly lower, but we do struggle in Wales in terms of the\u00a0Anglocentric nature of the media and so on. So, getting the messages out is a challenge. The other dimension is that when you're in a highly competitive recruitment market, you have to do what you can to look attractive. Part of that is about being able to invest in facilities, and\u00a0particularly buildings and kit, and the relative levels of investment between Wales and England over quite a long period of time now probably have an impact on that. Certainly, anecdotally I know, from my own family, that a lot of the choices have been made in terms of the state of repair of campuses and so on. There's something rational about that, isn't there? If you've got a system that is relatively better invested, then you're likely to have a better student experience because the resources are likely to be better. So, that's not irrational. We saw a sort of similar but opposite effect when the \u00a39,000 fee maximum limit came in, and some institutions, mostly in England\u2014there was one in Wales\u2014chose to pitch their fee levels really quite low, relative to that \u00a39,000, and caught a cold in the student recruitment market because fee levels denote quality in the student mind.\u00a0So, the price sensitivities work quite differently. So, again, if you've got a relatively better invested part of the system, then that might well be one of the reasons why it looks more attractive."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "That latter factor would affect the whole of the cohort, not just the international recruitment, of course."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Indeed. Yes, indeed. The implementation of the Diamond recommendations is crucial to that because that's re-balancing where the policy of investment goes."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. And Mark."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "If I heard you correctly earlier, you said that the applications from non-EU students were also down by 8 per cent or 9 per cent. So, forgive me a certain scepticism\u00a0about the explanation of the fall in the EU students being that they did get the fee grant and now they do not. If that's the explanation, why are we seeing the same fall in non-EU applications?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Well, I think the Welsh domiciled are also now having to face the prospect of finding a loan for the whole of the fee. So, that would potentially account for that. There's also a demographic dimension here with the downturn in the 18-year-old school-leaver profile, and that actually is happening in Wales at a slightly later point than in England."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "But this is non-EU students, and I think you said, Bethan, an 8 per cent or 9 per cent fall in them as well."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "International non-EU. I beg your pardon. I misunderstood."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "There's also a mix effect. I gave a number that was for all English institutions that there will be differential impacts on."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "All English or all Welsh?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "Well, I contrasted the Welsh position with the English position where they were seeing growth. If you look, then\u2014and we don't have the detailed information, but, again, what UCAS publish is some analysis by tariff. They analyse by type of institution\u2014in other words, the grades that you need to get into institutions\u2014and there is a trend for growth being in the higher tariff institutions. So, there's a mix effect in there as well, and I think there's undoubtedly an element of perception of how welcome overseas and international students are, and that's something that we know the sector are working on with Government."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Why would that affect Wales\u00a0more than England? Do you think there's been perhaps too great a negativity about Brexit in the sector?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "I think it's the mix of institutions that we have. So, we only have sector information published at the moment. When we look at the mix of institutions that we have, we will probably see a differential impact between Cardiff University and others."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay, Mark? Sorry, David, did you want to add anything?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I was just going to say that we would expect to see quite differential performance in the English sector, so the overall numbers are being brought up by substantial increased performance with some of that sector, and it's a question of how many of that type of institution you have in Wales."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "So, performance is increasing amongst the English universities, but not amongst the Welsh, you think."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I think performance is increasing, but increasing substantially with some of the English sector, not all of it. So, you get an average for the sector that is increased performance, but actually the stronger players within that sector, with the stronger international profiles, are bringing that up, and we have fewer in Wales that have that sort of presence."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Darren."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Would it be fair to say, then, that the universities over the border in England are better at selling themselves internationally than our Welsh institutions? Or is it just this fact that we've got fewer very high tariff universities versus the English market?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I suspect, and this is speculation\u2014I suspect that it's a bit of both. I think some of it is to do with the mix of different types of institution. I would then come back to the point I was making about the Anglocentric nature of the UK media. If you're looking overseas, I think Wales has to work harder to penetrate the consciousness."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "But, forgive me, don't international students just look at the UK as a whole? How are we comparing to Scotland, for example, or Northern Ireland, in terms of their universities? Do you have a comparative figure for Scottish universities?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "I haven't got that one with me for now, but there will be one in the data."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Yes, we could get that."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "Again, it's a combination of being part of the UK but differentiating, and the ability to differentiate the strengths of Wales, so attracting those students to Wales specifically, on top of the UK draw."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "So, in terms of the efforts that have been made, there's a programme now that is being run by the sector in Wales\u2014it's 'Study in Wales'. It's relatively recent; you could argue that we could have got there earlier. But that is a determined collective effort to present Wales as a good place to study, with particular messages about what distinguishes studying in Wales from studying more broadly in the UK. In a sense, that is responding to the need to increase the presence of Wales in an international market. So, that sort of initiative I think is very good, very welcome. It will take a while to actually have an impact, but I think that's exactly the sort of work the sector need to be doing more of."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "What are those messages on why prospective students should study in Wales?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "One of them in particular is relative safety. We know that one of the considerations, particularly for parents of overseas students, is are they going to go to a safe environment, and we know that the perception of international students who study in Wales is that this is a comfortable and safe place to be. That's partly a function of the size of our larger cities\u2014quite a lot smaller than many of the cities in England. So, that's a key message. Being part of a UK system is also an important message there as well. So, we've got a UK-quality system, a UK degree, and the strength of that brand is available in Wales, but it's available in a way that is safer and more supportive, I think is the messaging that's coming through."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. We'd better move on, I think, hadn't we? Darren, then."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "I just wonder to what extent you have been able to plan in your financial forecasts for the next few years ahead for the potential impacts of Brexit. What have you built in, if anything?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "In terms of our funding, we receive our funding annually, but the sector provides us with financial forecasts, and we use those for monitoring sustainability. So, the last full forecasts that we had were in July 2017. We are due to receive a full forecast at the end of this month, and we obviously have updated information from institutions."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "And they're three-year forecasts that come through to you, aren't they?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "They are four plus the current year.\u00a0So, we've got numbers to 2019-20 at the moment, and expect to go to 2020-21."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "And what are the universities expecting? What do they anticipate?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "Well, for 2017-18, which is the year we're about to end now, they were expecting \u00a338 million income from European students, and approximately \u00a391 million from the various European programme funding sources, and that's about 8 per cent of the total income\u2014\u00a31.5 billion\u2014of the sector. The forecasts are assuming that that continues, albeit that institutions\u00a0have various scenarios that they have for all sorts of scenarios that we can all speculate on, and, as I mentioned earlier, the balancing act of maintaining infrastructure and\u00a0resources and staff in the short term is where we are at the moment, or where the sector is at the moment. And there are also signs that the banks and lending institutions are becoming a bit more risk-averse in providing borrowing to institutions, and of more differentiation between individual institutions being made than has possibly been the case in the past. The sector made an operating deficit, again looking at all Welsh institutions collectively last year, 2016-17, of \u00a317 million. That's before other gains and losses. And we're expecting a similar collective level of deficit for this financial year, if not slightly higher. Now, these are managed deficits and we are not currently seeing critical short-term cash availability issues in the\u00a0sector. However, the increase in funding from Diamond is a key part of enabling the sector to return to longer-term financial sustainability. Short-term challenges can be met if there's a reasonable prospect of future funding. You can manage in the short-term, but there comes a point when the big cost reductions and\u00a0infrastructure reductions have to be made. And, again, having mentioned the pressures on pay, pensions and other challenges, it is difficult to gauge whether, if those factors come into play as well, some of these cost reductions may have to be made before funding comes in to replace\u2014either Diamond\u00a0funding or the European replacement funding."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "So, would it be fair to say that, in terms of the funding arrangements, and, in terms of the student numbers, one reason why we've got this recruitment\u00a0problem is this lack of investment in the capital infrastructure that we've\u00a0seen in recent years because of the\u00a0financing arrangements from the Welsh Government, and the fee regime that we had previously, and\u00a0the student finance regime that we had previously, not getting more cash into our Welsh universities perhaps, and that, over the next few years, there's going to have to be much more significant investment in capital if we're to raise the game and be more competitive, yes?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "Yes, that would be fair to say."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "So, to what extent are they planning for more capital investment\u00a0in those financial strategies that they've been preparing and presenting to you?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "They are all planning for capital investment. They are in different positions in terms of capacity\u00a0to borrow and the assumptions. This year, 2018-19, is the first time that we've had capital funding in our remit letter\u2014so, we've got \u00a310 million of capital funding, which is very welcome, with a prospect of a further \u00a320 million. So, that we will be allocating shortly. That will make a difference, particularly\u00a0to those institutions who are not finding it as easy to borrow from financial institutions. Some of our larger institutions have borrowed\u2014Cardiff University issued a bond. However, there are internal governance processes that are putting tight restrictions and\u00a0expectations of what that money will be invested in. But they all have plans to do it and they\u00a0need the confidence that their forecasts and long-term future funding prospects are secure enough that they can get the confidence of borrowers then, and service the costs of those borrowers."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "So, the Diamond dividend you've mentioned a few times. What clarity is there from the Welsh Government at the moment in terms of how much they anticipate the Diamond dividend will be, and what proportion of that\u00a0is going to be released to HEIs in the future?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "I was very carefully not describing it as a dividend\u2014a re-establishing of funding that we had in the past for higher cost and innovation and maintaining research funding. The timescales are difficult, because we have an annual remit letter, and we can work with Welsh Government officials, and they can only give us a sense of when they think the funding will be released. But 2018-19 is\u00a0the start of the system, and because of cohort protection\u2014so, protecting those students who came in on a different deal to the deal from 2018-19\u2014in the early years there is an element of double cost; there's a cost of seeing out the old system and the different cost of implementing the new system. So, at the moment, we're certainly not in a position to tell the sector with any degree of certainty what funding would be beyond what we've allocated for 2018-19, with some sense of what 2019-20 numbers we're working with because we allocate our money over an academic year\u2014so, by definition, we've already made assumptions of four months of the 2019-20 funding, albeit that's not approved yet in the budgetary process."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "But you're not being given a steer at all as to what you expect the additional resource that you might have to make available to Welsh universities might be as a result of Diamond. You must have some idea."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I think it's fair to say that officials have been as helpful as they can be with us, in terms of the planning assumptions we make and indications about whether or not we are being too ambitious or not ambitious enough. So, I think they're being very helpful; as Bethan said, they're constrained by the process\u2014they can't pre-empt a budget process. And you folks will be fully aware of that, of course. The other question I think you asked was how much of the money released by the new arrangements will come into higher education. At the moment, we are expecting all of it to come into higher education, as the product of the arrangement between the current Cabinet Secretary and the current First Minister. The extent to which any changes there cause that to come under threat is something I can't judge at the moment. But we have had in our remit letter from the Cabinet Secretary a clear indication that we can expect our resource to grow over the next few years, as the Diamond process unfolds."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. I'm just going to bring in Llyr at this stage."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Bethan said in an earlier answer that, I think, the financial forecasting from universities forecast something pretty consistent in terms of what they're hoping to be\u00a0receiving in income, for example. But we've already discussed the near 10 per cent drop, potentially, in international applications. So, does that tally, really, or are they going to be recruiting additional students from the UK market or\u2014? What's the plan?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "I was\u00a0reflecting on the last point when we had consistent information across the sector."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Okay. So, they may need to revisit that in the light of this."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "I'm expecting that the forecast that we get at the end of this month will reflect the reduced applications we've seen, and an element of that will be reflected in reduced improvements\u00a0as well."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Okay. So, we don't really know, then, whether\u2014it's unlikely that they are going to expect a consistent fee income, really."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I think it's fair to say we would expect them to respond to what they're seeing in the UCAS process. Even if they didn't, they would all, in any case, have sensitivities for what they would do if things don't come out in the way they hope. And if they didn't have that then we would be on their case, of course, because we want them to be properly sighted."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Okay. Thanks."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "And we have to stick to the Brexit impact. Darren."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Can I just ask, in terms of the impact of Brexit, have you done any assessment of what you think might happen, or have any of the institutions made available to you any assessments of what they think is likely to happen to their individual institutions, going forward? You've mentioned scenarios earlier on, David, so what scenarios have you set out?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "There's a Welsh Government HE Brexit working group, which is chaired by one of the Government directors, and we sit on that. And we have provided that group with early summaries of the risks and the potential impact, in terms of the exposure of the sector to EU-sourced funding. We have, as part of that working group, explored those issues that it would be really very helpful for either the Welsh Government to try to put in place or for the Welsh Government to persuade UK Government to do.\u00a0And I think, in our submission,\u00a0we identified\u00a0a number of areas of what we would consider to be a helpful action, and that has been worked through that working group. We know that it has informed Welsh Government's position, in terms of what it does and also in terms of the conversations that they have with\u00a0Her Majesty's Government. Beyond that, what we haven't done in that working group is share the work that institutions are doing individually to look at how they would\u00a0respond to different scenarios. We are not able to do that here either because, inevitably, they would have varying\u00a0degrees of unpalatability and they would have to be managed very, very carefully. You take cost out, which is essentially the response, you actually take people's\u00a0jobs out, and all of that\u00a0has to be managed carefully. So, that's not really a matter for public consideration, but we do know\u00a0that the institutions\u00a0are looking at a range of scenarios on what they\u00a0would do. Bethan mentioned earlier\u00a0on that the\u00a0current deficit for the sector is a managed deficit\u2014it's not something that has taken\u00a0them by surprise. They are responding to what they\u00a0see as the dip between where Diamond was reporting and where the money starts flowing. Similarly, I think we're comfortable\u00a0that there is a managed approach\u00a0to the scenarios that they're testing within institutions. So, they will do what they need to do to sustain themselves. The bigger issue really, in a public policy context, is the potential damage for the sector to be able to deliver for Wales in terms of research and skills development\u00a0and all the other contributions."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "So, you're confident that they're taking a robust approach\u00a0to planning\u00a0for various scenarios, going forward, are you, as individual HEIs?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Yes, and as the deal becomes more clear politically, then they will obviously have greater\u00a0clarity in terms of which of these scenarios\u00a0they need to work up more fully, but they are sighted on it."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Okay. Can I just ask about fee and access plans, and how Brexit might impact them? To what extent\u00a0do you think that they\u00a0could be impacted?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I think there are two dimensions to maybe touch upon there. Fee and access plans are approved annually by us. They are approved in advance of the recruitment cycle for the year that they apply to. So, we're just in the process now of finalising our consideration of fee and access plans for the 2019-20 academic year. So, there's quite a long lead time. We, as part of that process, go through similar\u2014we look at their financial sustainability, which is based on their forecasts\u2014data to the stuff we've just been discussing. And\u00a0also, of course, the fee plans themselves make assumptions about how many students of different types, from different domains, are going to be recruited. So, clearly, if there is a continuing downward pressure on EU student recruitment, then that will reduce the amount of fee income that's going to come in, unless they can find other students, and that will reduce the amount of investment in the various activities that are identified in the fee plans. In terms of process, we have two things that we can do. If institutions are becoming aware that the basis upon which they've submitted a fee plan is fundamentally different from the reality, then they can come into us for a change to their fee plan. So, we have a change process. If it's not fundamentally different, but there are always differences between what you plan and what happens three years later\u2014. We also monitor after the event and, if there are differences, we would then obviously require institutions to explain those differences. If they've had fewer students and less investment, we would need to understand that. Conversely, if they'd had more students, and potentially more investment, we'd want to know what they'd spent it on, and if they've done different things, we'd want to understand that as well. So, we do challenge through a monitoring process. The only other thing that's perhaps worth saying is that, in the 2019-20 fee and access plans\u2014they're not published yet, so I can't give you the full detail\u2014five universities have made reference to Brexit and the Brexit impact, and things they want to do through their fee and access plan to try and address some of those issues, so they're in there as well."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "But we've already said, haven't we, that it may be nothing to do with Brexit, this dip in EU recruitment, because there are other factors like the attractiveness of the estates and the environment that young people might be educated in? But they're making assumptions that it's linked to Brexit, are they?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Not really. I think\u00a0they're making assumptions\u00a0that it could be. There are things they want to do to enhance and to protect\u00a0student mobility, and some of that will be funded through fee plan investment. So, the Brexit conversation between the EU and the UK Government might or might not sustain\u00a0Erasmus engagement, and if it doesn't, then they need to find other ways of trying to support that sort of thing. So, that's what we're beginning to see in the fee plans. It's them thinking about how else we can do this stuff."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay, Darren? Mark."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "You mentioned the fee and access report. What else do you do to assure yourselves that Welsh higher education institutions are effectively planning\u00a0for Brexit?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "We've touched on contingency plans, but, in an environment\u00a0of uncertainty, I think it's difficult for any of us to know what the right scenario is. I think rather than looking at worst-case scenarios, what the sector is also focusing on is the promotion and looking for additional or increased sources of funding. So, we touched on strengthening the Global Wales engagement in order to sell Wales, so more focus on marketing Wales overseas, but also within the UK. The other area where the sector is working at a UK level very hard is making the arguments to UK Government for maintaining access to the successor to Horizon 2020, which is arguably a larger part of the whole funding infrastructure\u2014students is one part, but the whole funding infrastructure\u00a0for maintaining research capacity. So, working with UK universities to make arguments at UK Government level for maintaining access to those sources of funding is also a part of what the institutions\u00a0are doing. We mentioned the Welsh Government's HE Brexit group. That group, which is the Welsh Government\u00a0group, is being advised by members on it, and that's informing Welsh Government officials when they engage with UK Government\u00a0as well."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Do universities seek your advice on what the risks and, indeed, opportunities of Brexit may be and what you think they should be doing to plan for them, or is your role more one of monitoring what they do as opposed to advising what they should do?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "They are autonomous institutions and ultimately\u00a0their governing bodies are responsible\u00a0for ensuring their sustainability. It's not a relationship\u00a0where we would advise and direct, but it is a relationship\u00a0where we would question the scenarios if we consider from our experience that we would have expected other scenarios to have been tested. It's that nature of conversation, rather than directing."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "I understand you don't direct, of course, but my question was about advising. You're overseeing, or monitoring\u2014or whatever you like to describe the role as\u2014quite a number of institutions, and presumably you therefore have particular expertise within your organisation, and I just wondered whether higher education institutions are doing enough to draw on that."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "I think we can advise\u2014we can advise based on data and information that we can see. We can advise based on our judgment. The big thing in this whole\u00a0Brexit scenario is the uncertainty and the extent to which our speculation is better informed than the governing bodies or the sector collectively is probably the issue."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I think that's right. So, there's a relationship\u00a0with the sector and there's a relationship with individual institutions, and they are different. So, we have engagement collectively with the sector. Bethan meets with the finance directors, and I meet with the vice-chancellors. We actually\u00a0have the sector\u00a0and the funding council together on the Welsh Government's group. So, some of these conversations are happening in various ways, where we're all gaining intelligence about what might be a sensible set of planning assumptions. Then, if we see an institution that is manifestly giving signs of not being sighted on some of these risks, either through their forecast or through other assurance\u00a0activity, we will challenge. We have an annual cycle, with two points in the year where we reassess the overall risks of individual\u00a0institutions, and that's based on a whole range of hard data but also a range of soft data. Our links into institutions\u00a0are many and varied. We have lots of conversations and we take all of that in the round and form an assessment about the financial sustainability of the institutions but also the extent to which we think their governance and management arrangements are properly sighted and facing properly the challenges that they face. In some ways, we say it's not about the challenges they face; it's about how they face the challenges. Our alarm bells really ring when we get the sense that, actually, either an executive or a governing body hasn't really noticed. We're\u00a0not in that place, I'm really pleased to say. I'm not worried about short-term crisis with any of the institutions. There are medium-term real challenges, both because of Brexit and because of other contextual factors, but at the moment the sector is a managed sector, which is good. It's not always like that, but we're in, I think, a good place at the moment. So, our role is definitely to challenge where we don't think they are making sensible assessments, but it's not to say that their assessment is wrong and ours is right; it's just to have a conversation\u00a0about, 'Why have you done this and what has informed your thinking?' It's slightly more one step back and slightly more subtle, but it is, as you imply, us using the intelligence we gain from all of those conversations when we talk to individual institutions as well."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Llyr."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Yes, thank you. We had evidence last week from some of the higher education institutions, including Cardiff University, and it's very interesting, in relation to Erasmus+ and the mobility funding for students that, I think, only 40 per cent of the mobility funding in Cardiff is paid for by Erasmus+. I note that you've been consulting on national measures for higher education performance and that one possibility is using international mobility as a performance indicator. I was just wondering whether you might go further and expect universities to actually make commitments\u00a0to funding international mobility from their own fee incomes as part of that."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "Again, reflecting on the latest fee and access plans, seven of the universities are referring to mobility\u2014either they have targets in them or are explaining what their plans are\u2014so they are including an element of it from their own income and fee and access income. However, Erasmus is such a well-established and long-term plan\u2014if we were looking at a scenario where that infrastructure wasn't available, to implement anything similar to that would be much less efficient and much more costly. And to enable an infrastructure that allowed\u2014. Ideally, you'd want something that all Welsh institutions could take part in, and that takes some investment and some co-ordinating. And, equally, you need to have the arrangements with your overseas and European institutions. I think it's easy to underestimate the accumulation of time that has gone into establishing Erasmus. So, I think replacing it would be a challenge."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "And the point was made clearly last week that the brand is internationally recognised. When you enter into Erasmus+, you know exactly what you're going to get, and all of that. But there have been criticisms as well about degrees of flexibility and this, that and the other, so I'm just wondering whether\u2014and there is presumably going to be some change on that front although I'm hoping we can buy into it, as others have done who aren't in the EU\u2014that emphasis on encouraging institutions to look more proactively at funding their own mobility efforts would be positive."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I think the\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Sorry\u2014especially if it means that they do more of it."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Indeed. I think the Welsh sector is definitely committed to trying to find ways of promoting and resourcing that sort of mobility. There are signs that some of the restrictive elements of the Erasmus programme are going to change anyway, because that's under development and that's positive. There have been positive noises as part of the Brexit negotiations about wanting to carry on being able to access the Erasmus programme. Nothing is agreed until it's all agreed apparently, so we'll have to see on that one. That would be far better, I think, as Bethan indicates, than trying to replace it with a made-in-Wales only, but you could have a made-in-Wales on top. All of these challenges also create opportunities because they stimulate thinking, and so the fact that seven of the eight universities\u00a0are already now using their fee plans as a vehicle for thinking about this is positive, and I think we can take that on from there."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Because that 40/60 split struck me as being the opposite to what I perceived\u00a0the situation to be. A key\u00a0part of your role is to work in partnership with students, so I'd just like to ask what work have you done with students, in terms of maybe protecting their interests as the Brexit scenario evolves?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Well, as you say, we do work with students. We were the first of the funding councils\u00a0in the UK to have a memorandum\u00a0of understanding\u00a0with the National Union of Students in Wales. We work very closely\u00a0with them and the president\u00a0of NUS is an observer on our council. So, we have close links with NUS Wales and we're very proud of that, and it's very productive. They don't have a vote, but they do have a voice and it really matters. We we're, again, ahead of the rest of the UK in requiring all HE providers to have student charters and there are elements of student protection within the student charter. The UK-wide quality code also has elements in it where arrangements have to be specified about the protection of student interests. That is particularly, in essence, around circumstances where a provider gets into difficulties and they might wish to close a course or something more drastic and then what arrangements are in place to make sure that those students who are in train are protected. So, that is there and we've worked hard with the sector and with NUS Wales to get those measures in place. There's more development work in train at the moment, so we've asked Universities Wales to construct a protection that takes account of the approach to protecting the student\u00a0interests in higher education. We're also requiring\u00a0further education institutions\u00a0who are regulated and deliver higher education to do similar or the same, and that's very important. The students who are HE students in FE are absolutely not second-best, and they should have the same protections."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "But is all this a general piece of work? It's not Brexit-specific, although, no doubt, it may\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I think that's fair to say, yes. The other dimension around Brexit is the immigration status of EU students, and that's, kind of, beyond our pay scale\u2014that's a UK Government issue."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Is that something that you have a view on?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "It's clearly in the interest of the enrichment of the curriculum\u00a0and the student experience for students in Welsh institutions to be able to have students from other EU countries\u00a0in the mix. So, it would be nice to find ways of continuing to facilitate that."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Okay. Now, of course, you have a statutory duty as well to assess the academic quality of the work in our higher education institutions, and I'm\u00a0just wondering\u00a0what potential impacts you think that Brexit might have on that particular aspect."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I think there are possibly\u00a0a couple of things to say, and one, in a sense, echoes what I was just saying in the final part of my previous response, which is that part of the quality of the student experience\u00a0is the richness that you get from having students in your cohort who have different backgrounds and different perspectives. So, if there is a continuing\u00a0reduction in the number of EU students coming into Welsh institutions, then that richness deteriorates. That doesn't\u00a0mean to say that the base or the threshold standard of what's required for a degree will come under pressure, it's just about the richness on top\u00a0of that, which will be, in a sense, a quality-enhancement issue. That would be something that we would wish to try to protect against, but in the end you can't force EU students to come\u2014you have to try and look attractive, and we've touched on that. The baseline requirement assessment\u00a0of quality will not be affected by Brexit, except in so far as the machinery we use to discharge\u00a0our statutory responsibility, which is through the Quality Assurance Agency, which themselves\u00a0are accredited\u00a0with\u00a0European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education, the European machinery\u00a0for higher education quality. And there's a set of standards around that, and we would obviously wish not to be in a position where our ability to use and adhere to those standards is adversely\u00a0impacted upon. Those\u00a0standards will still exist, and it will be possible for the British system to adhere to them, even if they're not actually able to play in the same way. Then the only other thing I would\u00a0say is that one of the factors that can cause\u00a0the quality of the learning and teaching experience to be likely to become inadequate is when institutions come under financial pressure, just because their capacity to maintain the same sort of student experience can get under pressure. So, clearly, we will be looking for and making sure that institutions manage the financial pressures, if there are any\u2014and there are some at the moment, as we've described\u2014and manage those carefully. And in all of that, we will expect institutions to do their duty to make sure that the commitments they've already made to students are carried through. So, where students have already started on the course, they need to be able to finish that course\u2014you can't just pull the plug out. So, all of that comes into the arrangements for quality as well. So, we'll be keeping an eye on that."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Okay. A lot of what you've told us in the last three quarters of an hour or so will have costs attached, depending on the impacts. Certainly, we're in choppy waters as a sector anyway, and the risk is that things will be even more choppy, if you'll excuse that level of political interpretation, over the years to come. I'm just wondering what advice you might have given the Welsh Government in terms of what level of transition funding, or Brexit transition funding, might be required by the sector, and if you have, what the Welsh Government might have told you."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "I mentioned earlier that, obviously, we've provided information in terms of the assumptions that the sector are making on income. So, for the year 2017-18, that was \u00a3129 million. I think the extent to which that needs to be replaced or supported with transition funding depends absolutely on what the final arrangements for Brexit are, but it's an appropriate point to refer to the report that Professor Graeme\u00a0Reid has produced, commissioned by Welsh Government. That was, and has, provided advice and recommendations for supporting research and innovation in the transition period. But, again, the Reid recommendations in that report build on the Diamond recommendations, and as soon as\u00a0Diamond is in place\u2014and Reid is providing recommendations in addition, to establish funding on the basis that the funding needs to be available in Wales to maintain and develop and strengthen the research and innovation infrastructure that we have."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Are you not worried, though, that the clock is ticking and that we really don't know what the situation is at this point?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Do you mean the Brexit situation?"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "The Brexit clock, yes."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Uncertainty is unhelpful, because as I've said several times, the sector is a managed sector at the moment. I don't think there's\u2014. We're not seeing maverick stuff, but actually you can only manage, really, what you can see and what you can reasonably predict. So, the longer the uncertainty persists, the more difficult that is for institutional management and, indeed, for the rest of the machinery to support them. So, yes, the sooner we get clarity, the better for everybody, I imagine."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Chair, can I just ask a question?"}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Yes, Darren."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "In terms of uncertainty, though, we've still got this uncertainty over whether the extra cash that the Government's going to have to spend as a result of Diamond being implemented is coming to the HE sector. They've given a political commitment, but you've got absolutely no other assurance of the sums of money that are coming in. We've got the reform of tertiary education arrangements in Wales, which are also under way, so it's a bit of a perfect storm for you, isn't it, really, with all of these three things happening at the same time?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "We're certainly kept busy."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "But two of those things are in the gift of the Welsh Government to sort out for you, aren't they?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Well, the policy on the reform of the post-compulsory sector absolutely is a Welsh Government policy. The extent to which they can pre-empt a budgetary process and give us clear sight of the amount of money in future years is\u2014. Well, again, it's not for me to comment. My understanding is that that's difficult for them to do, and I would repeat what I said earlier: officials have been as helpful as I think they can be in respect of that. I mean, you're right, we've only got a political commitment between two people currently in post. It would be great to have that firmer. I'm not sure how that could be done."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "I mean, that statement about the savings accrued from Diamond being reinvested wholly into the HE sector has not been repeated, frankly, has it, since the coalition deal was struck?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "No, but it hasn't been rescinded either, so\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "No, but there have been opportunities\u2014repeated opportunities\u2014in the Chamber, where the Cabinet Secretary's been asked to repeat that commitment, and the First Minister's\u00a0been asked to repeat that commitment and has not given that commitment. That must concern you, and must concern your university sector even more than, perhaps, some of the elements of Brexit that we're discussing."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Bethan has outlined earlier on in this session the fact that institutions are currently running deficit budgets in order not to lose the infrastructure on the assumption that the Diamond money will come in. If anything were to cause significant perturbation, either to the timeline of that or to it coming in at all, then there would be much more of what Medwin Hughes calls 'houskeeping' that would be required, and that would be significant. So, at the moment\u2014I don't like the expression 'valley of death', but there is a valley to cross, and I think the sector is reasonably confident about how wide and how deep that valley is. There's a demographic valley as well. So, there are several valleys that they're crossing\u2014the metaphor fails, doesn't it, really, but I think you get the drift? So, there are a number of challenges and they can see their way out of some of those challenges, but if any one of these starts to get significantly disrupted, then that would be a real issue for them."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Could I go on to ask about other barriers to Welsh universities gaining more funding from UK research councils? What would you say those barriers are?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Well, I think there are a couple of things, really, to say. The first one\u2014and we'll sound like a stuck record if we're not careful\u2014is that there's an issue about investment and the Reid report makes this very clear. So, he has reaffirmed research that had been done previously that identifies that, actually, the quality of the research base in Welsh universities and the productivity of that Welsh research base are both good, there's just not enough of them, and that, in the end, is a product of investment decisions. They have particularly looked at the deficit\u00a0in science, technology, engineering and mathematics areas, and I always say that research is not just STEM. I mean, STEM is important, and I'm not denying the deficit in that area, but we have to also remember that the research agenda for Wales is not just STEM\u2014it's arts, humanities, it's social sciences. If you look at the impact on public policy that could come from social science research\u2014tremendous. And we're very good at it in Wales. The Welsh impact in its research is better than anywhere else in the UK, so that's good. So, they do very well, and we just really need to invest a little bit further\u2014so continue to do very well, but put it on a broader front. If you want to be able to play into the UK-wide research funding, then the investment has two dimensions to it. One is just having enough researchers to be able to play into those increasingly larger projects rather than small-scale projects. If you haven't got the critical mass, it's very hard to make the case that you can play. And the second thing is that UK-wide research pots nearly always fund at about 80 per cent of the total cost of the research, and the other 20 per cent is meant to be found from the core research funding for the university, and if you're in a situation where your core research funding is not competitive, then you're not going to be competitive at getting that money. So, that's, kind of, straightforward. There are other things. I think it's fair to say that the Welsh sector has not been sufficiently focused on getting in on the conversations with the research councils, making sure they're in the various committees and so on. We are intending to do a bit of work to see if we can systematise that a bit better\u2014that engagement\u2014because there's no doubt about it: it's not to say that this system is in any way inappropriate, but the more you're in the conversations, the more likely you are to be better placed to respond to the research challenges that come up."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. One final question: in terms of the researcher collaborations and networks that exist, do you see potential difficulties after Brexit for the continuation and enhancement of those, and are there any particular lessons to learn from\u00a0S\u00ear Cymru II?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I think that there are two things to say here as well. First of all, the Brexit deal might or might not impact adversely\u00a0on the capacity of Welsh and, indeed, UK research infrastructure to play into broader collaborative activity across Europe, and, in a sense, that's a function of the deal whatever the deal looks like, and we'll have to wait and see. But we've mentioned playing into Horizon Europe, and being able to continue with that would be an important part of that capacity. It's not just the money, it's being in the club and it's the signalling that we're in the game. So, all of that would be important. And then the other part of my response to this would be that, actually, Wales will need to continue to be good at the research it does, so maintaining the quality, maintaining the impact, and hopefully growing\u00a0the critical mass. The S\u00ear Cymru initiative has been quite important in doing that, because it's been very focused, capturing key research players, and the attractiveness that that has then to other researchers around them, and to industry collaboration, and they have been areas of real strength that we've invested in. And I think they are already showing dividends in terms of the capacity to win more research funding, and to establish an even stronger presence in the international research market."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Just one further point, from Darren."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Just very briefly, one of the pieces of feedback that the committee members received at a stakeholder engagement event, which took place prior to this inquiry starting, to receive oral evidence, was about the research funding that is available from the charitable sector, and how poorly Wales does in attracting some of that research. I think we had some figures from the British Heart Foundation, which said they have \u00a3100 million a year available for research grants, or something like that, and we're getting 1 per cent of that coming into Wales, which is\u00a0obviously pretty low down. I appreciate that research into the type of activity that they want to put their money into, Wales may not be\u00a0particularly good at, and there may be other opportunities with other charities and partnerships. What work are you doing in order to build the capacity that Wales has to attract more of that charitable sector research funding into Wales?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "One of the issues is the capacity to engage with that funding,\u00a0because of the overhead issue that David mentioned. Charitable funding at the moment doesn't attract any overhead funding. Again, that could be built in to our funding, if we had the capacity to increase our quality-related research funding. There is an element in England."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "But that pressure's the same in other parts of the UK, is it not? So the overhead funding is still an issue in England, and in other places."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "There is an increased contribution, and I think it's an element that was increased this year to acknowledge that. But there will be differentiation between different charities. I'm fairly certain that some of our institutions will be very strong with the cancer charities, possibly not the heart foundation. And some of that will reflect on focusing on our strengths, but to have that fuller picture."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "So, this gearing issue that you mentioned earlier on, for every \u00a31 that somebody else puts on the table, they can draw in another \u00a34 on top, because that \u00a31 will cover the overheads, whereas the rest of the research cash\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "That's exactly it. So, the more you're able to invest\u2014. You know, we sometimes get into a conversation about the unhypothecated nature of our research funding, but actually that creates a\u00a0flexibility and the infrastructure investment that allows institutions to be able to respond to these other opportunities. Without that, they can't do it, because if you're not careful, you've got\u00a0institutions engaging in UK-wide or charity-based research activities where they're actually having to pay for it themselves\u2014they're running at a loss."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "So that's the main problem; it's not that Welsh universities aren't doing their best to get this cash in. Or is it a bit of both?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I think, in the main, universities and researchers will get their cash from wherever they can, so I don't think it's a lack of appetite."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Okay."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Well, thank you, both, for coming in to give evidence to the committee this morning.\u00a0You will be sent a draft of the transcript, to check for accuracy. Diolch yn fawr. Okay then, the next item is item 3, papers to note, the first of which is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education\u00a0on the school organisation code. The second is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3 is a letter from the Chair of the Finance Committee regarding scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget\u00a0for the forthcoming financial year, which we will be discussing under item 6 on the agenda. Paper to note 4 is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on parental attitudes towards managing young children's behaviour. And\u00a0the final paper to note, paper to note 5, is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care\u00a0on the children and family delivery grant, which we will discuss later on in private session, if Members are content. Okay. Are you content to note those papers on that basis? Okay. Thanks very much. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to exclude the public from the remainder of this meeting, and also for items 1 and 2 of the 20 September meeting. Is the committee content? Yes.

The grading system has been admitted to be rigorous. Students were expected to be evaluated on their individual ability.

Hefin David pointed out that according to the response of an online survey, universities such as Cardiff University refused to consider the baccalaureate as a fair substitute for a full A-Level. However, Kirsty Williams claimed that he had a personal commitment to establishing the recognition of the baccalaureate with the universities and almost all Welsh universities recognized the baccalaureate as a qualification.

He exemplified some of them: the eagerness to adjust to the English system, the nature of the offer (the combination of the A-Levels that institution offered), etc. In conclusion, Kirsty Williams believed that no effective evidence could demonstrate that the avoidance of the baccalaureate was the sole driver for the students choices to move to other areas.", "relevant_text_span": [["132", "136"]]}, {"query": "What did Kirsty Williams think of the teachers' training for better skills of delivering the baccalaureate?", "answer": "On the topic of teachers' training, Kirsty Williams quoted from the ITE programmes that Teachers should be able to help children and young people to make links across their learning, bringing together different aspects to examine important topics such as citizenship, enterprise, financial capability and sustainability.

I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Cabinet Secretary for Education; Kevin Palmer, who is deputy director, pedagogy, leadership and professional learning; and Andrew Clark, deputy director, further education and apprenticeships division.

I was going to ask some general questions about the value of the baccalaureate. Could you give us your views on how the Welsh bac is valued by learners and teachers?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Bore da, Julie, and thank you very much for your question. Firstly, I'd like to begin by saying that I as the Cabinet Secretary value the qualification very much indeed. I believe that it helps ensure that we are able to give our young people in Wales a broad and balanced curriculum, recognising the need to develop knowledge and skills in core subjects but recognising also that the purpose of education is to help prepare our children for further study and the world of work, and I believe that the skills challenge element of the baccalaureate does just that. I meet with young people and teachers all the time who tell me about the positive experiences they have had studying for the Welsh bac, and much of that was evidenced in\u00a0Qualifications Wales's review into the Welsh baccalaureate. They did focus group work with a representative sample, and many of the learners expressed the fact that they have enjoyed studying for the qualification and have gained a great deal from it.\u00a0I meet regularly with individuals who have been able to use their bac to successfully gain a place at university, so I believe there's a huge value for Welsh young people being able to study this particular qualification alongside the more traditional qualifications that perhaps we're all used to. I think the challenge is that, given that many people are very familiar with what a GCSE is and, as parents, we will know what that is and many of us will have done\u2014some of us are so old we'll have done O-levels. We know what those traditional qualifications look like, and therefore a new qualification\u2014there's always a job of work to do to communicate that, if people aren't used to it, but I value it hugely. I think that, whilst there is always room for improvement\u2014and, of course, you'll be aware of the review that Qualifications Wales undertook and that has suggested ways in which we can further improve and refine the qualification, but I think it is a valuable piece of work for Welsh young people to undertake."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "It's great that you've been around listening to learners and what they have said about it. Have you had any negative feedback?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, occasionally, of course, we do have concerns raised with us, and those concerns are similar to the ones that have been raised in the Qualifications Wales review. So, for instance, we sometimes have concerns about how some students balance the Welsh bac with other qualifications they may be taking. Some teachers feed back around the workload issues associated with the Welsh baccalaureate. For some students, there may be concerns about the nature of the Welsh bac and whether that can impact negatively on their well-being. And, obviously, that's why Qualifications Wales have undertaken this piece of work so that we can refine, if necessary, that qualification and how we continue to look at how we ensure my belief that taking the Welsh bac should be the norm for students but also recognising that, in some cases, there needs to be flexibility to ensure that the well-being of the student is not compromised."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "And so would you say that it's valued by learners more or less at key stage 4 or post 16?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I think that, as I said, the vast majority of students I meet report very positively about the opportunities that are afforded for studying at that level. Occasionally, we hear from students who I believe think that in studying the subject they may be compromising their chances because they want to do additional A-levels, and I'm sure we'll come on to, later on, whether universities, and whether the Russell Group universities in particular, value the qualification. But I feel that there are particular strengths. And I think what's really important, and, in talking to universities, since the qualification became graded, rather than just a pass/fail qualification\u2014I think that added rigour since 2015 has been particularly important in ensuring that there's real value in students undertaking that work."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "And what about the effect that the leadership in the school has on the way that the bac\u00a0is received? Have you\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "As always, Julie, leadership is crucial, and students' experiences can be very coloured by the attitude towards the teacher delivering that particular course. And, therefore, we need to continue, alongside the WJEC\u00a0and Qualifications\u00a0Wales, to ensure that the Welsh bac\u00a0is communicated to children in a positive way, the benefits are explained to children and their parents, and, also, we need to ensure that those who are tasked with teaching Welsh bac in their schools or colleges feel confident in their ability to do so and to ensure that students have a really positive experience of that qualification, because if you're being taught by someone who is telling you,\u00a0'Oh, I don't know why we're having to do this', then, obviously that's going to colour how you feel about it. And, if I'm honest, I recently attended a youth forum, where young people from the county were discussing all sorts of issues\u2014everything from the environment to their experience in school\u2014and I was struck by the group of year 12 and year 13 students. I specifically asked them about the bac\u2014I always take the opportunity to ask them about their experience of the baccalaureate. One school, the group of students said, 'It's fantastic. We really enjoy it. It's really valuable. I'm learning a lot.' Students from a school seven miles away\u2014just seven miles away\u2014said, 'Oh, I don't know why we're having to do this.' And I suspect that that has got more to do with how that is being delivered in their institutions than it has about the quality of the qualification. So, we need to keep ensuring that those who are tasked with this see it as\u00a0important, communicate that to students, and have the confidence and the ability to deliver a really positive experience."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think our experiences in the committee are very similar. Within the same room, actually, we've had two completely different sets of views. So, what do you intend to do to try to ensure that there's consistent support and enthusiasm for the bac\u00a0from the leaders?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, first of all, we have the design group of Qualifications Wales looking to address some of the issues that arose out of the report around ensuring that, especially from a teacher workload perspective, it's not too onerous in terms of assessment. So, there's that to do to make sure that we're not asking children to duplicate and do things over and over and over again, which, of course, for any of us, would be wearing and we would question to the value of. So, there's the design group looking at the qualification itself. We are ensuring, as part of our professional learning for teachers that\u2014. There are existing opportunities via the regional consortia for support for teaching of the qualification. The WJEC has resources and support available, but we will look, as we roll out our national approach to professional learning, at that the professional learning needs of those already in the system are addressed. Of course, our accreditation for our new initial teacher education is predominantly addressed at being able to deliver the new curriculum, but, if you think about the elements of 'Successful Futures' and the skills and the knowledge and the pedagogy associated with that, it's very much in line with the Welsh baccalaureate challenge certificate. So, actually, there are opportunities via initial teacher education as well, and we continue to need to look to work with our partners to be able to reinforce why this is a worthwhile qualification. And I have to say I think the best people to do that\u2014. It's not me. I'd like to see past students of the Welsh baccalaureate being able to talk about their own experiences and why it's made a difference to them. I come across individuals for whom their place at university has been secured by that Welsh baccalaureate, and, all of a sudden, if that's what's got you your place, it becomes a lot more valuable than perhaps it was six months before. We need to make sure that students are aware, and teachers and school leaders are aware,\u00a0of the importance that this qualification\u00a0has."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Suzy, did you have a supplementary?"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes. I've got one on IT, but I'll leave that one. I just want to go back to Julie's question about whether there was a different perspective or a different sense of value for students who are post 16 and those who are pre 16. When one of the college leaders here was asked whether he had people coming to him in his FE college who've been through the pre-16 bac and had heard evidence or had stories of, basically, those children cobbling together their bac in the last four weeks of term before they got there, he said that yes, that is his experience. Does that worry you at all, because, of course, the whole purpose of bac is to teach skills over a period of time, and its purpose cannot be fulfilled by getting it all done in the last term of\u2014which year am I in?\u2014year 11, in order to satisfy the curriculum?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes. Obviously, that's not the experience that we would want young people to have, and, as someone who has had a daughter just finish\u00a0year 11, that's certainly not the experience that my daughter had in her particular school, and I have another daughter who has just gone into year 10, where the Welsh bac\u00a0has started in year 10 and it is a a two-year course in which elements are undertaken. Obviously, we will need to address, as part of the design group and the work that Qualifications Wales is doing, how that is playing out in individual schools. But that would not be a positive experience; we want this to be taken in exactly the same way as we would expect a GCSE to be taught over a period of two years. But, Andrew, I don't know if there's anything you'd like to add from the college perspective."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Clark", "content": "I think it is variable. I think that it will depend on the feeder schools to the colleges and it'll depend upon the delivery models that are in existence in those schools. It's been around as a qualification now for about a decade, I think. There have been differences in the way that the subject has been\u2014sorry, not the subject, the qualification has been delivered. And I think it'll be helped by a recent review by Qualifications Wales, because they're doing a survey at the moment as to different delivery models in different locations, and that, perhaps, will inform more even practice as we move forwards."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, and Estyn and consortia are looking at it as well. I don't want to cut across questions, so, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Clark", "content": "No, but it's a known issue, if you like, that various people are attempting to address and bring a more uniform mode of delivery across the nation."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "We've got some more detailed questions now on understanding, from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Just to drill down rather deeper into the issue of the variability in the way in which the Welsh\u00a0bac is provided, could you explain why you think that this inconsistency is happening, and then what the impact of the inconsistency and variability is on the value that learners attach to the bac\u00a0and their understanding of it?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think the variability can be perhaps explained by the fact that it's a new type of qualification, the fact that different schools have adopted it at different rates\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Ten years?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, as I said, over that time, there were some early adopters who have done it in a certain way, there are some people who've come later to it, who may be doing it in a different way. And, as I said, it's quite a different departure from traditional O-levels, from GCSE-type subjects, where there is a programme of work and a syllabus. So, it is a different nature of qualification, and, therefore, as Andrew has just alluded to, schools have approached it in a different way.\u00a0We are alert to that and Qualifications Wales, crucially, is alert to that, and we are looking to ensure greater consistency in how it is delivered in individual schools. We're also aware, in the school setting, in pre 16, there are some concerns about the onerousness of the workload associated with the evaluation of the students' work. Now, clearly, there is a difference between onerous and rigorous. We wrote the qualification to be a rigorous qualification for the students, but we don't want it to be jeopardised by the evaluation of it being too onerous. So, there's that balance to be struck. Again, that's one of the issues that the design group and Qualifications Wales are looking at.\u00a0That process is a really important process, so there is the design group, but working alongside the design group, who they are testing the messages and testing their thoughts with, is a stakeholder group, and\u00a0there is also a practitioners group. So, that work by the design group is being tested with those people who have an interest: business, for instance, the world of work\u2014is this qualification really giving students the skills that are valued by potential employers?\u2014but it's also testing its thinking with the practitioners, those people who will be charged with the delivery of the qualification, and I think that's really important to be able to get an understanding of the challenges of making sure there's a consistency, and what are the barriers to that, and what steps need to be taken to ensure a greater level of consistency in delivery."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Is there a correlation between consistency in general? Because we know that there's polarisation in the secondary school sector between the good schools and the not-so-good schools. And is there a correlation between\u2014if the schools are good according to Estyn, or excellent, are they also good, excellent at delivering the bac? Is it a fundamental inconsistency across the sector that's causing this inconsistency?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I don't know. I don't have that data to hand, but, of course, from next year, the bac will be a dedicated performance measure for schools. So, actually, we will be looking specifically at completion of the bac as part of the wider set of school performance measures. So perhaps we will be in a better position once that's formally established to be able to track progress."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Because some of the evidence we've heard is that if the leadership is good around the bac in the school, well, everything else follows from that. So, it makes sense to me that it could be."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Absolutely. As I said, I don't have the figures to hand, but, as I said, from next year, the bac actually becomes a formal part of the performance measures for schools."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Fine. I'll turn, therefore, to the understanding of employers of the Welsh bac and the skills challenge certificate. From the evidence that we've had, it appears that there is a problem in this area, that is, employers generally don't value the qualification. Is that your experience, and how can we improve that? How can we elicit more engagement from employers of all sizes with the value of the baccalaureate?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, the first thing to say is my understanding of the development of the bac is that employers' voices were reflected and they were part of the process that drew up the qualification in the first place. You'll be aware of the review by Qualifications Wales that found that many employers say that the skills that are developed through the baccalaureate are exactly the kinds of skills that they want young people to be acquiring whilst at school, that put them in a good place for looking for employment later. I would agree with you, Si\u00e2n, and not just in terms of the bac, there are lots of reasons why we need greater working between education and employers. I sit down with employer organisations to try and explore better ways in which we can work together\u2014everything from ensuring that children have work experience opportunities through to, for instance, what more some of our companies could do to take up governors' roles, for instance, in our local schools, so that employer voice and that business voice are heard at a school management level. I think these things are really important. It's something that's sometimes difficult. There are some excellent examples of really good practice where local employers work really closely with schools. I think of Sony in Bridgend doing a really, really, really good job working with their local schools. In other areas, where you haven't got such a big employer, it can be difficult, can't it, for a small business that is trying to do their small business to think about, 'Oh my goodness, I've got to do something to help improve the education system as well.'\u00a0So, I'm always looking at new ways in which we can get that working together. As I said, the Qualifications Wales design group has a stakeholder group that is helping them with their review into the qualification at the moment, but there are really good examples where employers and other organisations are working together. We also need to continue, I think, to communicate more clearly with employers the nature of the qualification. Again, because it's relatively new, and the brands of the GCSE and A-level are so strong, people know what they are, unless you've either done the Welsh bac yourself or you have a son or a daughter, or a grandson or granddaughter who has gone through the process, you're probably going to be less familiar, and we need to continue to work together with the WJEC and Qualifications Wales as a Government to better communicate the value of the qualification."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "So, you agree that there is a specific piece of work that needs to be done around employers and that the Government should be leading that."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, and we are working closely with, as I said, Qualifications Wales to develop a joint communication plan, and we continue, as I said, as part of Qualifications Wales's review into the nature of the qualification\u2014employers' voices are being heard as part of that particular piece of work. But more generally, yes, I think there's more that we can do to better engage employers with the education system in lots and lots of different ways."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Not just on the Welsh bac."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Just before we move off this section, the variability that the committee has seen has been quite pronounced, really. We've been to a school where they've got a passionate and dedicated Welsh bac\u00a0school leader, but then we've spoken to other schools where it's tagged on to a variety of teachers' roles, and that clearly has an impact on the way it's being taught. You said in your answer to Si\u00e2n that you're trying to ensure more consistency in the delivery of it, and you referred to the performance measures; are the performance measures the main vehicle by which you're going to ensure consistency, or are you planning to issue any more guidance to schools on how it should be delivered on the ground?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We will need to reflect the work that Qualifications Wales is undertaking. Professional learning, I think, has a role to play as well as performance measures. So it's not just one thing that we can do that will change this, it is a number of things\u2014everything from the communications plan to making sure that teachers who find themselves responsible for delivering this feel confident and have had the professional learning opportunities to give them the skills so that they do a great job in delivering a positive experience to students. The performance measures, of course, as we know\u2014sometimes in schools, it is those that make schools focus on something. So there's a wide variety of ways in which I think we can look to ensure more consistency. But, in the end, I think it is professional learning and teacher training, ITE, that will make the biggest difference."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. And just on understanding, one of the things the young people in Crickhowell told us was that they thought the name should be changed. They felt that it wasn't reflective of exactly what the qualification is and that maybe having something that was clearer would be better. Is that something you've considered?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, first of all, I need to declare an interest, because that's the school my daughter goes to, and I don't know if she was the one\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "She wasn't. Angharad wasn't there."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "She wasn't the one who said that. Certainly, I'd have to reflect. My gut instinct tells me that one of the issues that we have is developing an understanding of the brand and what that qualification is, and if we move away from 'Welsh\u00a0bac' and suddenly start to call it something else, I think that could be even harder and set us back from where we are. So, that's not to dismiss it, and I would want to reflect on those views, but I think if one of the issues that we've got is developing a better understanding of the qualification; if we were to suddenly change the name of it, that might have the unintended consequence of making that job even harder. But, obviously, if the committee was to make a recommendation, we would\u2014I'm happy to reflect on that evidence, but, as I said, my gut instinct would tell me that there could be an unintended consequence of moving away from that brand."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. The next questions are from Dawn Bowden."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. You touched on this once or twice in answers to questions about how rigorous the qualification is. We've had mixed evidence, I would suggest, from groups of stakeholders. We've heard people say that the Welsh bac\u00a0has no rigour, that pupils are spoon-fed. We've heard that the Welsh bac\u00a0is passively marked, the grades are inflated, that there's little rigour\u00a0in the sampling and moderation, there's a confusion about how the SCC is graded, and I know that's something you talked about, actually, that introducing the grading system is improving the rigour. I suppose my question to you is: if the Welsh bac\u00a0is being seen in this way by stakeholders, how are going to address that? To what extent is that a real problem?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think making it a graded qualification has been really important,\u00a0and I make no apologies for this qualification being rigorous\u2014no apologies for that at all. That's how it should be, and that's how you create value, by ensuring that a qualification is rigorous. What's really important is that it's not just me saying that it's rigorous; there is an independent process that benchmarks qualifications. The fact is that at advanced level\u2014because I don't know if you're making these observations about the pre-16 Welsh bac, or whether we're talking about the advanced level qualification\u2014that is the equivalent of an A-level. It's been benchmarked against A-levels. It has a UCAS tariff associated with it. It is used by universities as a means of qualification that gains entrance into a university in just the same way as an A-level is. So, therefore, I don't have any concerns about the rigour of the qualification. In terms of spoon-feeding, one of the reasons why universities like the qualification is that it's very difficult, for instance, in the individual project work to be spoon-fed. It is very demanding of individual students, and it's very difficult in a way. That's one of the reasons why it's valuable, isn't it, because it teaches a different set of skills? Because if you're doing a traditional, say, history A-level or a science A-level, there's a very strict syllabus and a course, there's a textbook and people are taught to that particular syllabus; with the Welsh bac, it is individual students that have to think, for instance, of their own individual project. You can't get those off a shelf, and you can't necessarily just find that information easily. There's real skill involved in being able to do that well and get graded well for that. So, I do not have concerns about the rigour. I do have concerns about some of the feedback by Qualifications Wales about the onerousness of the evaluation and what that means for teacher workload, which is one of the things that Qualifications Wales is looking at. But in terms of rigour and people being spoon-fed, then I don't share those concerns."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay, because those were concerns, in the main, that were articulated by people delivering the Welsh bac\u2014by teachers. So, I suppose the question then comes back to some of the other points that were being raised about the consistency, because that may well be from those teachers in schools where they're not taking the bac as seriously as some others are."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And, of course, there would be\u2014. There is a professional responsibility for those teachers delivering that qualification to ensure that the ethos of that qualification and the skills\u2014. It would potentially be a disservice to students if that qualification was being delivered in that way."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "And I think what I was trying to do was to highlight the different opinions, because we also heard from teachers who were saying that those involved with teaching and studying understood absolutely its rigour, so it was the mixed message, I guess, I was just trying to test out with you. Similarly, on the skills challenge certificate, again we've heard from various stakeholders about whether, in fact, this is considered to be an equivalent qualification. We've heard people say that it is different\u2014it's not the same as an A-level\u2014so, therefore you can't absolutely hold it up and say it's the same as an A-level. It requires different skills, and so on and so forth. So, just your thoughts and views on that, really, as an equivalent qualification."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "It's not a question of if this is an equivalent qualification; this is an equivalent qualification. There is a rigorous process that is undertaken to evaluate these qualifications independent of the Government, and it's not a question. Is it a different model and a different way of studying? Yes, of course it is, and that's why we do it. That's why I want children and young people to do both sets of qualifications, because it does engage and expand the acquisition of knowledge and skills. So, yes, it's different. Is it equivalent? Yes, it is, and that's why, since the graded qualification came in, it is regarded by independent bodies as an equivalent to an A-level, and it has a tariff for UCAS in the same way as A-levels would have tariffs. You only have to speak to the institutes of higher education who use this qualification as a way\u00a0of setting grades\u2014you know, offers\u2014for students that they see that in the same way as well."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Suzy's got a supplementary before we go on to talk in detail about universities."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Is that okay? Because I just want to go back to this element of spoon-feeding at post 16, where you said it's actually very difficult for that to occur, because, obviously, we're talking about the personal project, and so forth. We heard evidence in one of the schools sessions we did that baccalaureate students were being offered a very short and narrow list of subjects on which they could do their personal project, which actually limited the scope of what they were able to do. And we've also heard separately\u2014it may have been with the colleges, I can't quite remember now\u2014that some students were being told, 'On your personal project, just put in what you did for your GCSE-level baccalaureate, and add a few paragraphs.' I'm wondering how easy it is to disguise spoon-feeding at post 16 when we've got two instances there that, to me, suggest it's more about the convenience of the teachers, who perhaps may not be very enthusiastic about the bac, rather than making sure those children get the best out of the qualification."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes. And that would be really disappointing. And, again, if I can use my own personal family experience, my daughter has tried that on with her Welsh bac teacher. She's in a different school from where she did her earlier bac, and she said, 'Oh, well, I'll just rehash my \"Votes at 16\" that I did last year', and the Welsh bac teacher has said, 'Under no circumstances are you to do that\u2014no, that's not allowed.'\u00a0This is about using your individual project, linked to something that maybe you hope to study at university, to get the value out of this qualification, and for you to be able to use this in your personal statement, and potentially in an interview. So, again, I guess what this does is show that there's a variation, but certainly, where it is being delivered well, then that practice would not be encouraged, because it would be seen to be\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "It's gaming."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "\u2014denuding the students of the very valuable experience the qualification has to offer."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. Cheers."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. We've got some questions now on how universities view it. Hefin David."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "We've had an online survey response, which was quite a stark comment, not from the vice-chancellor's office, but from a member of staff within Cardiff University. And it said: 'The Welsh Bacc is not a fair substitute for a full A-level, and should not be regarded as such. I consider it to be a disadvantage for Welsh students, compared with their English counterparts.' Can you reflect on that?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I don't agree."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Do you think that that's a view that's held within universities, and are you concerned about that? Because it is a view that's obviously held within Cardiff University."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No; I would say that that is a view held by an individual in Cardiff University\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Who has influence over students."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, that is a view held by an individual in Cardiff University. And, actually, Cardiff University\u2014indeed, all Welsh universities\u2014accept the Welsh baccalaureate as an A-level equivalent. I think it is really important to reflect on the wide range of opportunities at higher education that the Welsh bac affords individuals. That means that it is deemed as an equivalent to A-level for the vast majority of universities, to get in to some of the most competitive courses, such as dentistry, medicine, veterinary science. So, those courses where we know there's a high demand and high competition for places, there are institutions that are using that, including Cardiff to get into their medical degree."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Nick Brazil, the deputy principal of Gower College, said about 50 per cent of the Russell Group don't value the Welsh bac."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I don't know where he's getting that from. I have made it a personal commitment to establish this with universities. I have visited both Cambridge and Oxford. I spoke again to Cambridge, Oxford, Bath, Southampton, St Andrews, only last week, who were exhibiting at the Seren conference. I specifically took the opportunity to meet with those universities and to talk to them about how they feel about the Welsh bac. They have a high regard for the Welsh baccalaureate in a variety of ways. First of all, for many of those universities, for many of their courses, they use the Welsh bac as an equivalent to an A-level. If they don't, there are some courses, for instance, where they will lower their offer to gain a place at that university if the Welsh bac is passed at a certain level. So, for instance, rather than maybe offering a Welsh student A, A, B, they would offer a Welsh student A, B, B, plus a Welsh bac, thus giving students two opportunities to gain a place at that university, either with or without their Welsh bac qualification. Even for those universities\u00a0that don't use the Welsh baccalaureate as a formal part of their offer\u2014and this is the conversation I had again last week with Oxford and Cambridge\u2014they value it as part of a student's personal statement; they value it as part of the interview process in which a student may or may not then be offered a place at that university; and they also recognise that the skills learnt by students whilst undertaking the Welsh baccalaureate are exactly the skills that those students\u00a0need to make a successful transition from A-level work to university-type work, which, if you can imagine, is very much based on individual research and being able to guide your own learning. So, I just don't recognise that in some way Welsh students are being disadvantaged. The message I get consistently from universities\u00a0is that there are significant advantages to Welsh learners taking this qualification."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. You can not recognise\u00a0it, but that is contrary to the evidence that we've received. I'm not saying that the\u00a0evidence is conclusive, but it actually demonstrates inconsistency. So, would you go so far as to accept instead then that there is an inconsistency in the way that universities\u00a0use the Welsh bac as a tool for application?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "You would know better than anybody, Hefin, that universities are autonomous institutions and they set their own methods of entry into those institutions. What I'm telling you is that the evidence that I have received from universities is that, whilst there is a variety of approaches to how they regard the qualification in terms of offers, consistently, absolutely across the board, all universities tell me that the Welsh baccalaureate is a valuable qualification and does not disadvantage Welsh\u00a0students."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "If the committee were to produce a report based on the evidence we've received, that would be contrary to what you've just said. So, I think we'd end up in a debate in which we are setting out different points of view. So, would you therefore commit to exploring that perspective?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Hefin, I would argue that I have indeed explored that perspective because I have taken the trouble to find out first-hand\u2014not via my officials, but first-hand\u2014from those institutions, their views. So, this is not something that is hearsay; I have undertaken to ascertain the views of those universities. We have written to all vice-chancellors\u2014last year\u2014with regard to the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. Qualifications Wales has an individual whose specific job it is to ensure that universities across the United Kingdom understand the value of Welsh qualifications. That will become increasingly important as we see a divergence between English and Welsh qualifications. But I have to say that the evidence that I have from universities is that the Welsh baccalaureate, whilst it may be used in different ways in terms of an offer, the consistency from all universities is that it is a valuable qualification. If you've heard differently from admissions tutors and from the universities officially, rather than from somebody who has e-mailed in, then I would be pleased to look at that evidence, because it would be in stark contrast to what I am being told by universities."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Hefin\u00a0is not referring to an e-mail\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "No, I've said that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "\u2014we did do a survey and we've also taken oral evidence."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Yes, and it's representing the evidence that we received."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And I'm presenting you with the evidence that I've received."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But it will be presented to you as a submission from this committee, no doubt. Let's look at some admissions offers instead then. You do concede that there is inconsistency with how admissions offers are made with regard to the skills challenge certificate. How would you suggest that that is addressed?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Hefin, each individual\u00a0institution\u00a0and university the length and breadth of the UK have different ways in which they make offers to individuals. What is absolutely clear to me, and if the concern is around the type of institution\u2014. So, for instance, it is accepted as a third-grade offer in Bristol, Edinburgh, Exeter, Lancaster, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, the London School of Economics\u2014some of the highest performing universities and Russell\u00a0Group universities. It is accepted as a fourth qualification or amends the offer in places like Bath University, and it is accepted in tariff-point offers in places like Hull and the University of the West of England. So there is a variety of ways in which universities use the qualification, and that is their prerogative\u2014that's their prerogative as institutions.\u00a0They will have different ways in which they recruit and how they offer places, just like different universities will have different views on unconditional offers. You know, there's a difference in universities there, isn't there? Some universities don't have unconditional offers at all; other universities\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, what you're saying is that the problem isn't connected to the Welsh bac, it's connected with just the way that universities make offers, and the Welsh bac\u00a0has got nothing to do with it."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I\u2019m saying there is a variety. Just like any other qualification, there is a variety in how universities use qualifications for offers. What I\u2019m saying to you is that, in the conversations that I have had with Russell Group universities, what they say is that there is certainly no detriment to any Welsh student\u00a0undertaking this qualification. They value the qualification. They think it is useful. It develops a set of skills that help students to make that transition into higher education. And therefore, I think it is a myth\u2014I would go as far as to say that it\u2019s a myth\u2014that Welsh students are disadvantaged in any way by taking this qualification. Sorry, Andrew."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Clark", "content": "Could I just add to that response? There are, obviously, differences in the way that universities treat the skills challenge certificate and the Welsh baccalaureate, which is the prime focus of this. The attitude of the universities has changed significantly since that was a graded qualification."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, that has made a difference."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Clark", "content": "And even those who do not make it part of their offer consider it exceedingly valuable in the way that young people are prepared to go to university and, therefore, as part of their personal statement, as part of their interview, the activity that the young person has taken by means of the skills challenge certificate is definitely recognised, even by those who don\u2019t actually make it part of their offer. So, we\u2019re still on a journey\u2014that graded qualification\u00a0has only been taught for a couple of years, but the journey is taking us to the right place, towards the right destination."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. So, it isn\u2019t just about variable admissions practices across universities; it is to deal with the skills challenge certificate as well, which needed changing in order to improve that."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Clark", "content": "But that was changed in September 2015. When it was a 'yes'/'no' qualification, I think they held it in less regard than they do now that it is a graded qualification."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And that\u2019s\u00a0the conversation we had with some of our Russell Group universities."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Clark", "content": "And that was an important shift three years ago."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. So, last question, then: are you absolutely confident that any concerns we are offering are nothing really to worry about?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We will need to continue to communicate to all audiences the importance of this and the value of this qualification. But I am confident that the university sector, in its wide variety of forms, regards the Welsh baccalaureate qualification as a valuable endeavour for Welsh students to undertake, and they certainly don\u2019t regard it as a detriment to students."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Si\u00e2n wants to come in on this, and then I've got a question from Suzy on Seren."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes, just that the committee, of course, has been trying to gain evidence on this sector from the universities themselves, but Universities Wales, which represents the interests of universities in Wales, has rejected the committee's invitation to submit any oral or written evidence. So, can you see the dilemma we're in? We are hearing a few things coming from some universities, we hear what you're saying, but we can't get to the root of the matter because the universities themselves aren't willing to come to speak to us. Are you also disappointed that they have rejected our invitation to come and speak to us?"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Where's the enthusiasm, Chair? Where's the enthusiasm?"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And perhaps that's a sign that they don't want to be drawn into this argument between the Government and us as a committee."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, it\u2019s a matter for individual universities to decide whether they want to participate in the work of this committee. I would urge them to do so. All Welsh universities regard the Welsh baccalaureate as an equivalent to A-level, and all universities use it as part of their offer\u2014Welsh universities."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes, but you see what our dilemma is, though, because if we can\u2019t actually ask them directly,\u00a0it's a bit\u00a0difficult for us to actually probe this and to help move things on? Anyway, I'll leave it at that. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, it's a matter for them, and maybe the Chair would like to take that up with Universities Wales."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "We have had quite an extensive dialogue with them about it. Suzy on Seren."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "So, just briefly, you\u2019ve said several times that having a Welsh bac qualification is an advantage and certainly no detriment, and that it\u2019s valued by universities. But advantage isn't\u00a0the same\u00a0as equivalence, and we have had evidence from\u2014I think it was Cardiff University, again, where they had students with two A-levels and a bac who were actually performing as weaker students. So, even though on the face of it you've got three A-levels, those particular students aren't matching up to the expectations of a student with three A-levels. I do want to challenge what you said about the students who are involved in the Seren network about the baccalaureate being accepted for things like veterinary medicine and medicine itself. We've had evidence from FE colleges, which are now significant players in producing our Seren-style students, if you like, that they are exempting their students from doing the bac\u00a0because it's a distraction, effectively. What's your comment on that? Because if this is a question of communication, which I suspect you're about to tell me, one of the axioms of good communication is you can have the best marketing in the world, but if the product you're selling isn't highly valued then you're actually just doubling the problem. So, can you explain to me why FE is exempting their highest flyers from doing the bac?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think sometimes colleges make the decision that four or five A-levels is of an advantage, and therefore, if you're asking students to carry that workload, which is a considerable workload, that's the preferred route for more able and talented students. Again, what is quite clear in all the conversations that I have had with Russell Group universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, is that this is a myth. What universities tell me they want is not necessarily students with four or five A-levels; they want students with three really exceptional grades at A-level and a Welsh baccalaureate. I think that's really, really an important message to get across\u2014that it is not necessary to do four or five A-levels if you aspire to go to these Russell Group universities, or if you decide you want to apply to Oxford and Cambridge. As I said, in the conversations that we have had\u2014and there is actually some research, and I will let the committee have links to the research. There is some research to suggest that those students who have been involved in project-based work\u2014and, of course, that's not just the Welsh baccalaureate, that would be the EPQ, which is a qualification that is rapidly gaining traction in England. That is an extended project\u2014research based\u2014qualification, very similar to the individual project element of the Welsh baccalaureate. The EPQ\u00a0in England is seen as a qualification taken by more able and talented students, and what we see in some of the research that is coming forward is that those students who have engaged in that type of work, project-based work, individual-led, research-based work\u2014those skills are the skills that are really attuned to the nature of university-type work. Therefore, that is valued by universities and there is some indication to say that there is a correlation between the students who have undertaken that work and their potential success at undergraduate level. They also tell me that there is a link between, for instance, being able then to use those skills to gain work experience, placements and internships in the private sector and in the world of work, because, as I said, those types of skills are really, really valuable and therefore that's why they value the qualification."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Can I just add\u2014? It's great that they're telling you, why aren't they telling FE?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, as I said, I think it's really important that FE colleges understand that there is a myth around the fact that these universities are looking for four or five A-levels, and if that's the reason why then colleges are not allowing students or dissuading students from taking the Welsh bac, I think we need to reflect on what's important to those universities\u2014which is the right A-levels. I think it's really, really important that students are given the best advice about the A-levels they need to take, facilitating subjects to get into a university, and the value of the skills and knowledge they will acquire through the Welsh bac\u00a0as an assistance to them going forward."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, thanks. Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Actually, it's your set of questions next on universal adoption."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I'll try and keep this on the shorter side, if that's okay, everybody. You say in your evidence that you expect universal\u00a0adoption, basically, by 2020, I think it is, or it might be 2019. What do you think universal adoption actually means? What does it look like? Does it mean 100 per cent adoption?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "What is means is that I expect all institutions to be in a position to deliver the Welsh baccalaureate. I believe it should be an entitlement to all Welsh students to be able to study this qualification, and I believe we should work to the situation where it becomes the norm to take the Welsh baccalaureate. I also recognise that in some individual cases, there may be very good reasons why perhaps this is not aligned to the well-being of that particular student. But when I talk about universal adoption, I expect all our institutions to be in a position to deliver the qualification, and I believe it should be an entitlement for Welsh students\u00a0to be able to undertake this qualification."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "But not an obligation\u2014that's the bit I'm trying to get at."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think it should\u00a0become the norm, and if there are exceptions to that, and there could well be for very legitimate reasons, I think that that flexibility should be allowed. But I think, for those students who are not doing that Welsh baccalaureate, there should be evidence as to why that decision has been taken."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, so there's a presumption. I think the performance measures, probably, are likely to sharpen the minds of some school leaders, so I won't\u00a0pursue that. But can you tell me what lesson you may have learnt from the universal obligation for students to study Welsh language in schools\u00a0when those schools weren't particularly ready to offer a quality course?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "As we've rehearsed\u00a0earlier, it is important that all of our schools and colleges are in a position\u00a0to deliver this qualification well and deliver a really positive experience to learners. That's why there is existing support available, and via our new professional learning programmes there will be more support available for teachers to ensure that they have the skills and the confidence to deliver the qualification in a high-quality manner."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Well, that's going to take some time. Would you consider\u00a0pausing the presumption of universal\u00a0roll-out until you're absolutely sure that all institutions are able to offer the bac to the quality\u00a0that you would like to see it delivered?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Not at this stage. I have no intention of pausing. We have evidence that schools are already delivering the qualification\u00a0really well\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "But you know that we've had evidence, and you must have as well, that not all schools are doing it."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "What we do know is that some schools struggle to deliver existing qualifications. I don't know\u00a0why we would turn round and say that this qualification needs to be stopped\u00a0when we wouldn't\u00a0stop other qualifications, and we'd say, 'Well, there we are, we haven't got a 100 per cent guarantee that every single school is delivering this particular qualification especially\u00a0well, therefore we're going to denude the opportunity of students to study that particular subject.' What we're saying is, 'There is a responsibility\u00a0on us, on individual schools and on our regional consortia to endure that there is professional learning in place so that all schools are in a position to deliver the qualification well.'"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Isn't it irresponsible to ask students to be obliged to take a qualification that's badly delivered?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "What is irresponsible is not to invest in professional\u00a0learning to ensure that all schools are in a position to deliver it well."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Well, I agree with you on that, actually, which is why I was a bit confused when you had some in-year additional money in this year's budget that was being given\u00a0out to consortia rather than to schools to improve the ability of their teachers to deliver the Welsh baccalaureate in certain schools. Can you tell me whether the money\u2014I think it was about \u00a35 million that was going to the consortia\u00a0in-year\u2014will you will offer them suggestions that that is used for improving baccalaureate teaching?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "The money that is available is going via consortia to schools. Individual schools are best placed to understand the professional learning needs of their staff. And if that school understands that they have particular professional learning needs for the Welsh baccalaureate, then I would expect the money to be spent on that. Where a school is doing the Welsh baccalaureate particularly well, then the school might identify other areas where they look to seek improvement. Therefore, it is for the individual school to assess the professional learning needs of their staff. We can't second-guess that, and therefore it has to be right that school leaders are able to plan the professional learning of their staff accordingly."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I completely accept that and, as I say, it's\u00a0not for all schools, but bearing in mind we're facing evidence of polarisation of delivery, I'm\u00a0just wondering whether there wasn't a letter\u00a0suggesting\u00a0that they may want to focus on this in the schools that aren't delivering this well at the moment."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, again, that's a conversation to be had between challenge advisors in our regional\u00a0consortia who are aware of the strengths\u00a0and weaknesses in individual\u00a0schools, in conjunction with the leadership of those schools, to discuss how that professional\u00a0learning money is best spent. There isn't a school that is fantastic at everything, nor is there a school that is not good at anything, if you know\u00a0what I mean. There are strengths and weaknesses\u00a0in all schools. It is for the regional consortia, via challenge advisers, and the headteacher, to have that conversation about what the professional learning needs are for that particular school, to ensure that all their teachers, across the length and breadth of the curriculum, are in a position to deliver good-quality lessons. But we can't second-guess that."}, {"speaker": "Kevin Palmer", "content": "Can I just make a further comment? I'll be this afternoon meeting with the regional consortia, Estyn, the universities, and the rest of what we call 'the middle tier' to discuss with them the configuration of a national curriculum for professional learning, premised on the priorities that are emerging from our current work with pioneer schools. And the shifts in pedagogy that you all know is found behind some of these issues, with the delivery of the Welsh bac, those shifts in pedagogy are right at the core of the national approach to professional learning\u2014so, things like project-based learning, the kinds of things you talked about today, moving away from a spoon-feeding model, not just for the Welsh bac but actually right across the curriculum. The new curriculum requires us to move in these new directions. So, it's absolutely true to say that each individual school is different, each individual practitioner is different, but we must give the regions and the HEIs, as it were, a menu of things, and guidance around where there are clearly weaknesses in schools. Those weaknesses need to be addressed."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I accept that we're going forward towards Donaldson, and I'm sure that you will be getting questions on that at some time in the future. I'm more concerned about this bac\u00a0that's been around for 10 years, and there's still, as far as we can tell from the evidence that we've had, poor delivery in some schools, where there's the prospect of obligation on the horizon. That was the thing that was worrying me. Anyway, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "I think the issue of the difference between entitlement and obligation is a very important one and is a concern to students. You were saying it's an entitlement, not an obligation, but we have had very clear evidence from colleges that some of them are making young people do it, and schools are making young people do it. So, what do you say to those schools that are insisting on their pupils doing the Welsh bac\u00a0at post 16?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "As I said, I hope that it becomes the norm that at post-16 level students take the Welsh baccalaureate, because I think it is of huge value. There may be circumstances that mean that the well-being of that student could be compromised by making them do this qualification. There could be a whole host of reasons why it is not suitable for a child to take this qualification, and therefore there has to be some flexibility in the system, and we have to trust in the professional leadership of our colleges and our headteachers to make that decision in the round, with the pupil and their parents, about what's in the best interests of those pupils. But I do think a situation where, perhaps, an entire cohort of students are suddenly deemed it's unsuitable for, I find that very hard to believe, but there could well be circumstances, for a whole host of reasons, where that particular qualification\u2014. And we would not want to jeopardise the well-being of a student by forcing them to do a qualification that wasn't in their best interests, and we need to have the flexibility in the system to allow school leaders to make that decision, but they should also then be accountable for that decision."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "But do you recognise there's maybe a case for strengthening guidance, then, on this? Because, we've had teachers tell us that they have insisted on pupils doing this, and then the parents have rung Welsh Government, and they felt undermined, then. So, do you think there's a case for strengthening the guidance or clarifying what the position is to schools and colleges?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Very happy to do that. As I said, from time to time, parents do indeed contact Welsh Government, and in that contact there is a whole variety of reasons why that parent feels the Welsh baccalaureate is not in the best interests of those children. Sometimes, that can go from the extreme of,\u00a0'I want my child to do five A-levels and I think that's in their best interest to get into Oxford and Cambridge'\u2014I would argue that that is a myth, around the need to do that many A-levels\u2014through to, 'Actually, my child has a range of learning needs, and actually this qualification isn't suited to them. Making them go out and do voluntary work in an organisation with people that don't understand their needs and they are unfamiliar with could jeopardise\u00a0my child's ability and my child's well-being.' So, there's a whole range of reasons why sometimes people have concerns about the Welsh baccalaureate. Some of those are very legitimate concerns. Sometimes, they're based on information that, perhaps, isn't correct, or the myths around, 'I need to do five A-levels if I want to go to Cambridge'. Schools, then, have some flexibility. I'm aware of a case last year where a parent felt very concerned that the students were also having to study for entrance exams into Cambridge. A conversation was had with the school. They were able to allow the student extra time to study for that qualification and pick up their Welsh bac work later on in the academic year. So, they were able to be flexible in the delivery of that qualification. I'm very pleased to say that we've had correspondence from said parent to say that his son went on to do exceptionally well in his A-levels and his Welsh baccalaureate and gained his place at Cambridge University, and that's about having the flexibility, even at a school level, to be able to respond to the needs of individual students."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Just one final question from me on this, then. As you know, mental health and the emotional health of our children and young people is a very core issue for this committee, and Estyn have said that studying the skills challenge certificate alongside three or four A-levels is a significant factor in causing stress for some young people. How do you respond to that?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I would be the first to acknowledge that studying A-levels can be a very stressful time. That's because students, rightly, regard those qualifications as high stakes and as having a profound effect on the opportunities for the rest of their lives. So, the mere fact of studying A-levels can be a really stressful time for students because they understand how important they are, and students want to do well and they want to be able to move on to the next stage, either of work or of university. We also know\u2014and Estyn\u00a0reflects this\u2014that students are also often trying to combine that with part-time jobs. These students are of an age when they want to be out and about and earning some of their own money and being a bit more independent. So, that adds added pressure to them. So, undoubtedly, this is a stressful time in young people's lives and we need to ensure that there is support in school to support young people through this time to make sure that students are making the right choices in terms of their A-levels and the qualifications that they're doing so they're not having to do more because they're under the impression that, by doing more, that's going to make them more likely to succeed. What we know, actually, is it's about the quality of what you do rather than the entirety of what you do that's important to universities, and we need to make sure that students are getting really good information, advice and guidance and support at what is a challenging time in their lives, because, of course, it comes on top of working really hard for your GCSEs and then you have, the following year, AS-level examinations and A-level examinations after that. So, these are stressful times in children's lives and they realise the importance of these as high-stakes qualifications."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. The next questions are from Janet Finch-Saunders."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "This is about the wider impact of studying the Welsh bac\u00a0on other curriculum subjects and education provision, and we've had representations in that it is causing some concerns. So, do you have any concerns about the effect that the Welsh bac\u00a0may be having on wider education provisions, such as the narrowing of the curriculum at key stage 4?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No. Obviously, schools are responsible for planning their local curriculum offer, and that needs to meet the needs of their learners, and it also needs to meet the needs of the Learning and Skills (Wales) Measure 2009. So, there should be a wide variety of choices available. I believe that the skills challenge certificate actually does ensure that there is a broad curriculum and that children are exposed to different learning opportunities. And so, rather than narrowing it, I believe the Welsh bac\u00a0helps us to make sure that there is an expansive curriculum, and that lots of different issues are explored in the skills challenge certificate that ensure not just academic skills are developed, but, actually, knowledge and skills of a wider range of subjects about you and your place in the world is available via this qualification."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay, thanks. And then, to what extent do you think that the Welsh bac\u00a0should be give priority over other curriculum subjects?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I don't think it's\u2014. It shouldn't be at the expense of other subjects. It should be part of that wide range of opportunities that are afforded to students, and I don't think it's more important\u00a0or less important than\u00a0other aspects of what we already ask schools to deliver."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "What about where we've taken representations that there's a lack of capacity in terms of all the extra pressures of studying the Welsh bac along with other qualifications? I went to a school in Bangor, and, again, as has been said here, it's very polarised, the evidence that we're taking\u2014either some have found it very easy or some, including teachers, have found it extremely difficult to fit everything in, and they do believe that there is a lack of capacity there."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And the onerous nature and the consequences of workload for teachers is acknowledged by the Qualifications Wales work and review into the qualification, and that is one of the things that we're looking to address so that the assessment arrangements and workload implications for teachers are not too onerous. And, if there is any element of duplication\u2014students being asked to do things over and over\u2014then that needs to be addressed as well, and that's why there is this review by the design group."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay, thanks. And then, how do you respond to concerns that learners are avoiding studying the Welsh bac\u2014 where they can, that is\u2014by\u00a0attending institutions in England or institutions that do not offer Welsh-medium provision?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, it's interesting, isn't it, about where children choose to study and whether they are motivated by the avoidance of the Welsh bac? People make decisions about where to study for a whole host of reasons, and it's difficult sometimes to quantify what those are. So, for instance, we often hear this along the border that, because\u2014. The geography is not easy, but it can be relatively easy to go across into the English system and therefore you don't have to do this. Now, the reasons for that could be very variable. It could be about the nature of the offer. We know that, in some of our rural schools, the secondary sixth forms aren't able to offer a wide variety of A-levels, and perhaps, by going to a different institution, a larger institution across the way, then you can get that combination of the A-levels you want to do, which simply isn't possible if you do it in your home school. Or, we do have some consortia arrangements where A-levels are delivered across a wide variety of schools, which require students to travel. Some students don't want to do that; they don't want to do their A-levels in three different schools, but they'd rather go to an institution where they can do it all under one roof. And that means, sometimes, moving across the border or, in the area I live, children making the decision to go to Merthyr college, because its a lovely, beautiful new building, the facilities are absolutely fantastic and a wide variety of A-levels is available under one roof. We looked at, in particular, also, the perception of quality. So, if we take the example of King Henry VIII School in Abergavenny, a school where, in the past, there have been, I think, within the community, some concerns about the quality of that school\u2014whether it's regarded as a good school. And, from that particular location, you can quite easily get to Hereford college\u2014a college that has a fantastic offer, does very, very well and has a beautiful building. What we do, if we look at the tracking of the students who have been retained in King Henry VIII, as that school has been on its improvement journey and has done better and better and better, the number of students that they are retaining into their sixth form has grown. So, the perception is, 'This is a good school, I'm going to get a good-quality experience here', and more and more students are choosing to stay in that school than perhaps make the decision to travel somewhere else. We also have to recognise that, for some students, staying in the sixth form isn't what they want to do; they want a different experience, they want to go to an FE college. They want a different experience. So, we have to take into consideration that students could be motivated by a wide variety of subjects, and there's no hard-and-fast evidence that it is avoidance of the bac\u00a0that is the sole driver for some of these choices."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Si\u00e2n, on this."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "The evidence that we've had from one of the teaching unions\u2014robust and clear evidence\u2014is that this is happening, that is, that young people are leaving Wales to go over the border to schools in England in order to avoid the Welsh bac. That's exactly what was said to us. But you don't accept that evidence."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I'm not saying that I don't accept it. I'm saying that I think\u00a0there are a wide variety of reasons\u00a0why students make decisions about where to study. I'm not aware of any comprehensive piece of work that has looked at those motivations, and I think there could be a whole host of reasons why children are deciding to move across the border. Perhaps the Welsh bac is an easy one to place that hook on, and that's easier to acknowledge, isn't it, than saying that perhaps students are making that choice for other reasons."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. The next questions, then, are on teacher learning from Suzy."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Actually, I've asked the question that I wanted to ask."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, you don't want to\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "By all means you ask the others I had."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. You have referred to training already. The committee's got two concerns, really. One is about preparedness in ITE to teach the Welsh bac, so I don't know if you want to expand on how teachers are being skilled up at that level to deliver the Welsh bac effectively."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "In the accreditation process, which has not been without its pain, and some significant decisions made in that regard, the criteria for the ITE programmes note that, and I'm going to quote it: 'Teachers should be able to help children and young people to make links across their learning, bringing together different aspects to examine, for example, important topics such as citizenship, enterprise, financial capability and sustainability.' So, the prime driver for our ITE reforms, obviously, is the preparedness for 'Successful Futures', but in preparing our teachers to be in a position to successfully deliver that, those are also the pedagogical principles and that shift in pedagogy that we see aligned to the Welsh baccalaureate. So, it is actually a part of the accreditation process that the curriculum that the new ITE providers will have to deliver\u2014ensuring that teachers have those skills and have that confidence to be able to deliver their teaching in a way that, as I said, ensures that we successfully deliver on Donaldson, but also on the same pedagogical principles that are needed for the successful delivery of the Welsh bac."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "In the pre-Donaldson period, then, bearing in mind what you've just said, do you expect to see a surge in improvement on how the baccalaureate is taken up by those schools that are currently less keen on it?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I hope that we will see increased numbers of students taking the qualification and an increase in the quality of that experience for young people. As we discussed earlier, we're not just waiting for the new graduates to come out of our ITE providers. There's a whole cohort of the workforce already out there. They should be given an equal opportunity to ensure that they have the skills to deliver on our curriculum reforms and our reform qualifications, and every time the previous Government has brought in a reformed qualification there have been specific resources made available to ensure that teachers are in a position to do that. So, when we changed to maths numeracy, a new qualification that was to be examined, there was specific resource made available for the professional learning for teachers to make sure that they were in a position to do that, and that's exactly the same as the offer that we have available for teachers who are delivering the Welsh bac."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. And you've already said about continuing professional development, that this is going to be a core part of the CPD. Is there anything that you want to add on that? Is it going to be fully integrated into the professional learning offer?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, absolutely. There is already\u2014I don't want to make the impression that there's not already support available out there. There is already support out there via regional consortia for professional learning with regard to the Welsh baccalaureate. There is existing support available from the WJEC with regard to Welsh baccalaureate, and it will continue, as we drive forward our national approach to professional learning. And, increasingly, there are interesting ways in which we're supporting students, so I don't know if Members are aware of the new MOOC. The University of Bath, one of the Russell Group universities, delivered a MOOC for the extended project qualification in England."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "What's a MOOC? [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "So, it is an online\u2014a massive open online course. So, it's a course that is delivered free of charge, and it's delivered by information technology. So, the University of Bath have done this MOOC to support students with the EPQ. They have just launched, in conjunction with Aberystwyth University, a bilingual MOOC for the individual project for Welsh bac. It's our understanding it is the first ever Welsh-medium MOOC, we think; we're not aware of any others. And this resource is there for students to give them advice on how they do choose the thesis for their individual project: how do you go about, then, undertaking good independent research; how do you reference properly, to ensure that you do that correctly? And we've seen over 1,000 students already sign up for the MOOC. So, increasingly, there are lots and lots of new resources out there for both teachers and students to make the most of. And the fact that Bath and Aberystwyth have worked together on this, I believe, shows their commitment and a demonstration of their support for this qualification, otherwise why would the University of Bath bother, if they weren't interested in it?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Just one final question from me. I've written to you about a young constituent who moved institutions and resat the Welsh bac, but wasn't able, because of the WJEC\u00a0policy, to obtain a higher grade in it, because they've got a policy that the grade is capped when you resit it. Given what the committee's been told about the variability in\u00a0the way this is taught in institutions in Wales, do you think it's fair that young people shouldn't be able to go and resit it somewhere else and get a better grade?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, given that Welsh Ministers are independent of the qualification system, I would want to be careful about what I said, because it is for the WJEC\u00a0and Qualifications Wales to regulate this. But, clearly, we would want to reflect on making sure that students have an opportunity, and a fair opportunity. Andrew, I don't know if you've got any observations that you'd like to make."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Clark", "content": "No, not really. I think it's an individual case, this one\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "But it could apply to lots of young people, couldn't it? I mean, that's the point here. I know it's a constituent's case and I don't normally raise those in the Chair, but I think, given what we've learned about variability, it is a valid issue for young people in Wales, really."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Clark", "content": "Yes, whether it's particularly related to the Welsh baccalaureate, though, I'm not so certain. And I think that would be a better question to ask the WJEC, perhaps, and Qualifications Wales, because it's a deliberate act that that activity is at arm's length from Welsh Ministers."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Any other questions from Members? No. Okay, well, can I thank the Cabinet Secretary and her officials for attending?

I am tabling a petition related to Bill C-7, the government's euthanasia bill, which seeks to dramatically remove safeguards that the government said were vital only a short time ago. When some people are living in deplorable conditions, we cannot truly speak of them as having a choice of when they ought to die. Especially in light of that new information, I commend this petition for the consideration of members of the House. The second petition is in support of Bill S-204 on organ harvesting and trafficking, put forward in the Senate. The bill would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ without the donor's consent.

The petitioners have asked the government to implement a wage supplement as a temporary measure to bring the wages for those who are in contact with the general public and working in what has been deemed an essential service to no less than $20 an hour, in light of their service and the risks they're taking for all of us."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We have a point of order from Ms. Harder."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Rachael Harder (Lethbridge, CPC)", "content": "Mr. Chair, the honourable member who just spoke brought up a great point yesterday.

This year has been a lot different, owing to the COVID situation, but our Scouts are not used to saying the word impossible. David Chant, head leader for their cub pack, reached out to share that the youth have found innovative ways to engage our community through a virtual food bank. I say a big thank you to Scout leaders like David, who are strong role models for our youth, teaching them the importance of leadership, kindness and giving back. I've always been amazed with the support within our community for the Scouts' food drive.

This is a very important industry, and this year's Tourism Week is a little different from what it normally is. The ongoing coronavirus crisis has closed provincial and international borders to recreational travel, and tourism operators from coast to coast have been among the first and hardest hit due to the government-mandated lockdowns. Clear criteria regarding border reopenings and health and safety requirements will allow hospitality and tourism businesses to sufficiently prepare to reopen. This includes rehiring employees, ordering supplies and putting together tour packages and marketing plans. Operators do not need to be set back any further because of a lack of clarity around reopening. While this Tourism Week is not a celebration like the one we had expected, I anticipate next year's celebration to be a celebration of an even stronger and more successful tourism industry in Canada.

In fact, last Tuesday, at a parliamentary committee meeting in the Senate, the Parliamentary Budget Officer made some very scathing remarks about the government. He said he was concerned. He said that there had to be a deadline or we'd be heading toward taxation levels that haven't been seen in generations in this country because there is not a lot of ammunition left before we go into a large structural deficit. I'm not the one saying it; it's the Parliamentary Budget Officer. For weeks, almost every day, the Prime Minister has been announcing cash injections for Canadians. We agree with that. However, hundreds of billions of dollars are being spent without any idea of the deficit. That's why we're sounding the alarm and calling on the government to be careful. The Prime Minister needs to know that we can't play Santa Claus every day, because the bills in January come in fast, and they are high."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We will now go to Mr. Garrison."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Randall Garrison (EsquimaltSaanichSooke, NDP)", "content": "Mr. Chair, making sure science informs our health policies is critical during a pandemic. That's why I'm so disappointed that the Liberals have maintained the ban on blood donations from gay men and trans women. There is no science behind this ban. Not only does it reinforce homophobia and transphobia, it also reduces our blood supply at this critical time. Now we've learned that the ban will also result in rejecting plasma donors, when plasma is so critical in emerging COVID-19 research and treatment. More than 17 countries, including Argentina, Italy and Spain, have no deferral period for men who have sex with men. They know that behaviour-based screening provides better security for the blood supply than discriminatory identity-based rules. I have asked the minister many times to lift the gay blood ban and I do so again today, but today I also call on the family and friends of gay men and trans women to step up now and donate blood in place of those of us who cannot.

It's for people who need it, not for millionaire political parties like the Liberals and Conservatives. In Rivire-des-Mille-les, as in many other ridings, we respond daily to businesses that don't have access to it. Unfortunately, there are people in our ridings who won't have the opportunity to hire staff this summer. There are businesses that are losing less than 30%of their revenues; they are losing29%. These businesses won't have access to it. Everywhere we look, there are businesses that are falling through the cracks. Meanwhile, the Liberals and the Conservatives are getting the wage subsidy to fund partisan activities. I repeat: it is to fund partisan activities. The Liberals and Conservatives don't even do it on the sly; they do it openly. These two parties have raised millions of dollars since January. Every dollar that's taken comes out of the taxpayers' pockets. It's the workers' money, not the political parties'. It's so embarrassing that it's shameful, disrespectful and ridiculous. The Liberals and the Conservatives have to pay that money back. I think that's obvious. For the Bloc Qubcois, its immeasurably clear.

They were treated with profound cruelty and carelessness. Among many other loathsome details, they were left to starve, were abused and lived in filth, their cries of anguish ignored. They were tormented and left in their agony. There is no excuse for this. No one ever deserves to be treated the way they were. I am talking about humanity, about compassion and mercy.

At the beginning of the crisis, the government called on entrepreneurs in Quebec and Canada, inviting them to set an example in the situation we are experiencing. Many of them turned to the supplemental unemployment benefit plan to maintain the employment relationship and to preserve some security, enabling their employees to get through this difficult period with more peace of mind. However, on May22, despite the fact that these entrepreneurs had made sure that the SUB program would still be in place when the CERB was introduced, they were surprised. Employees were told at that time that they would have to repay the CERB because of the alleged gains they had made under the SUB program. At SOPREMA, one of the large employers in the Drummondville region, 150employees are affected. At Bridgestone, in Joliette, 1,100employees are affected by this decision. At Goodyear, in Valleyfield, 150employees are affected, and there are dozens more.

What does she have against the fact that we are going to meet again this summer? What is it that she does not like?"}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "Ms.Gill, you have about 30seconds left for your comment. Go ahead."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Marilne Gill", "content": "Let me teach the Leader of the Government in the House some arithmetic. First, 37.5hours per week, as well as the time we spend sitting on our normal committees, is quite a bit more than the eight short hours each week he is giving us. Second, once again, the leader said that it is absolutely not in his jurisdiction. So he reaches agreements with parties though his word is worth nothing. I hope that the NDP has not reached an agreement with him."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Pablo Rodriguez", "content": "Mr.Chair, it all depends on government decisions, and clearly, we are having discussions with the provinces. Actually, we have already started doing that. However, I still do not understand what she has against having more time than I do to ask questions. I would really like an answer from her."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "We will now take a brief pause so that the technicians can spell each other off.  Order. I see Mr. Bezan on a point of order."}, {"speaker": "Mr. James Bezan (SelkirkInterlakeEastman, CPC)", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chair. Earlier, during the question time here, Mr. Sweet, the member for Flamborough-Glanbrook, got up and was raising a number of issues about the Hong Kong protests, where 360 people have been arrested. The People's Republic of China, the regime in Beijing, and their rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, are circumventing Hong Kong legislation and the Hong Kong government in putting their own will upon the people of Hong Kong. I believe this demands an emergency debate here in the House of Commons. Mr. Chair, I'm asking if you would rule on this and schedule an emergency debate so that Parliament can actually discuss this crisis, this human rights crisis, as political protestors are being imprisoned because of their standing up against the communist regime in Beijing."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "I thank the honourable member, Mr. Bezan, for his point of order. It was really more of a request. He may know, and for the benefit of other honourable members, that we're operating in this Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic under the auspices of an order made earlier this week. There is no provision in that order for emergency debates. However, I would certainly encourage him to speak with his House leader, whips and others. Of course, he'll know that discussions of this sort are being shared, so he might want to pursue that opportunity. I see Mr. Bezan rising. Mr. Bezan, is it a different point of order?"}, {"speaker": "Mr. James Bezan", "content": "No. I'd just like to respond to that if I could."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "Well, there's"}, {"speaker": "Mr. James Bezan", "content": "Mr. Chair, this is the problem with this special committee. Our rights and privileges as members have been completely degraded. It makes it impossible for us to address the issues of this day."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "Mr. Bezan, we're all operating under an order that was agreed to by the House. We'll stick to those provisions. Again, understand the situation we're in. Certainly circumstances do change, but I leave that to the party leaders to decide.

My questions are for the Minister of National Revenue. Minister, I've been informed by some of my colleagues that CRA officials have been directing constituents to phone their member of Parliament to resolve CRA-related issues. Why on earth would CRA direct individuals away from the agency during this stressful time when they're just trying to get their tax information and file their taxes?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Diane Lebouthillier", "content": "Mr.Chair, I thank my colleague for that important question. I can tell you that CRA employees have to deal with questions put to them. It is not up to MPs' offices to deal with specific questions about individual files."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Marty Morantz", "content": "Minister, you didn't answer the question. These are your CRA officials directing constituents away from the CRA. You really should be answering that question and not just talking about how inappropriate it is, although I appreciate that. Also, on your website, it says that the telephone service for the individual-inquiries line will be available to Canadians until June 5, and there is no further information about further live service. When will you get your agency under control and make sure it provides an actual person on the other end of the line to provide the information that taxpayers need?"}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "Just before we go to the minister, I would remind hon. members to address their questions through the chair. It's a little bit different from when we're questioning witnesses in a committee. We're using the rules more related to what we use in committee of the whole. The honourable minister has the floor."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Marty Morantz", "content": "On a point of order, Mr. Chair, as far as I'm aware, this is not Parliament; this is a committee. I've been sitting on committees since October. I've talked to my colleagues, and no chair, including the chair of the finance committee, has ever asked me to address a question through the chair. So with the greatest of respect, unless this is in fact Parliament, which I'm told it's not and the Parliament voted that it's not, we really should be able to address the witnesses directly, should we not?"}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Morantz. This really is a question around the way in which this special committee on COVID-19 has been structured. We're operating under the rules that were agreed to by the House in an order that was passed and adopted on Tuesday of this week, so we're bound to manage the affairs of this committee in that way, and one of those includes asking members to address their comments and questions through the chair to other hon. members. So I ask you to abide by the rules of the committee, and we'll pursue that. Now we'll go to the response to your second question. The honourable minister has the floor."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Diane Lebouthillier", "content": "Mr.Chair, I must thank the officials who have done excellent work during this historic COVID-19 period. I must tell you that CRA call centres are an essential service and the agency is able to answer calls quickly. The employees are answering calls from their homes."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Marty Morantz", "content": "Some of my colleagues have spoken to the CRA about drop-off boxes for paper returns actually being removed at some locations, citing COVID-19 as a reason. Has the CRA removed these boxes at all locations? Given this, will you commit today to make paper filing postage-free, since paper filers can no longer drop off their returns at all of the locations?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Diane Lebouthillier", "content": "Mr.Chair, I thank my colleague for that important question. At the CRA, we continue to process paper returns and to do the work that we usually do. I repeat, I must highlight the exceptional work that the agency employees are doing."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Marty Morantz", "content": "On the subject of paper returns, there have been numerous reportsin fact I asked you on May 10 for a written response at the government operations committee, OGGO, which I have not yet receivedon the delays in processing paper returns. Apparently this is still ongoing. When will Canadians who filed paper forms have their returns processed so they can get the refunds they need during this difficult time?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Diane Lebouthillier", "content": "Mr.Chair, I can confirm that the Canada Revenue Agency continues to process paper returns. Because of COVID-19, we have had to implement distancing measures to protect the employees. We must ensure that employees are safe, but we continue to process paper returns."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "Mr. Morantz, you have about 45 seconds left. Go ahead with your question."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Marty Morantz", "content": "Sure, Mr. Chair. During this crisis, the problem of illegal tax evasion and avoidance has been highlighted. The minister has been the minister since 2015 and should be able to answer this question off the top of her head. How many successful prosecutions have there been in Canada for the illegal use of tax havens?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Diane Lebouthillier", "content": "Mr.Chair, as we have said, one of our government's priorities was to invest almost $1billion to establish a system intended to fight tax evasion. That was not at all a priority under the Conservatives. We continue to do that important work for taxpayers; everyone must pay their fair share."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "That concludes the 13thmeeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Speaker Rota asked me to remind all honourable members that during the next meeting, which will be next Monday, we'll be watching more carefully the time for members' statements. We're allowed one minute. We ask members who are providing those by virtual conference to time their statements to within one minute, as he will start to cut off members who go beyond the one minute.

Dealing with this pandemic was extremely challenging and the government had to make decisions quickly to ensure public safety. The main concern as the education Minister was to protect all staff and pupils in schools and other educational settings. Their belief was that no child shall miss out on any education, unless absolutely necessary. From next week, schools would have a new proposal which would help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak. The key was that they were looking at supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning, which included all of those who benefited from free school meals and children with additional learning needs. What they needed to do now was to do all the work together as they were facing the continuing challenges posed by the coronavirus."}], "specific_query_list": [{"query": "Summarize the discussion about policies and measures related to free-school-meal children during the pandemic.", "answer": "According to Kirsty, they are actually in an unusual situation but they were trying to create a system where it would be seamless and it would not necessarily matter that two of those weeks were formally holidays. One particular group of children and young people that they hoped would be eligible to be included in the potentially vulnerable category was young carers. The basic principle they used was that even if it was a minority of children who went to those schools and were vulnerable, they deserved and needed the support through the school.", "relevant_text_span": [["16", "42"]]}, {"query": "What were the measures concerning the normal holiday provision for children?", "answer": "Kirsty admitted that they were now in a strange situation. What they were trying to work to was that they would have ongoing provision. Also, they were trying to create a system that would run uniformly. Such was a rapidly-evolving problem and the scale was something that they had not seen in 100 years. Therefore, they would have to evolve and iterate things as they went. Now they were worried about displacement activities. During the holidays, every head teacher would be in school on Monday with their staff.", "relevant_text_span": [["16", "28"]]}, {"query": "Would that be possible that they might move children on to fewer sites?", "answer": "Based on Kirsty's words, this was a potential. The local authority had already chosen some locations and was already having communications with how they would then staff the centers. The local authorities were best placed to understand what was the best, pragmatic use of the resources that they had available, and of course those resources, primarily, were human beings. They wanted to give the parents confidence that, when they left their child with us, that child would receive something really worthwhile, and they could direct all of their attention to doing their job.", "relevant_text_span": [["29", "40"]]}, {"query": "How would special schools fit into the new purpose arrangement?", "answer": "Already, local authorities were making different provisions. Even in special schools, there would be children whose parents would be key workers. Therefore, they would expect them to expect those sChools to apply the same principle. They would have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely, given the nature of the special school. Thus, they would look to cater for that within the original school.", "relevant_text_span": [["41", "42"]]}, {"query": "Summarize the discussion about ideas about timescales for setting out what approach would be to handling the lack of exams.", "answer": "Kirsty believed that it was a devastating decision to have been taken. But they had done so on the very clear and unambiguous advice from Qualifications Wales. They were dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it, and those human beings could find themselves unwell. Therefore, their best attempts would be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exam's day in August, but that had to be caveated by the fact that they were dealing with difficult circumstances. With regard to AS-levels, no final decision has been made for exactly how those students would be treated. There were a range of options that could be used. With regard to other types of qualifications, the vast majority of BTECs was a modular continually-assessed piece of work, and they would have every expectation that BTECs would be able to be awarded.", "relevant_text_span": [["61", "81"]]}, {"query": "What was the further clarification and advice about coursework?", "answer": "According to Kirsty, all exams were cancelled, but year 11 and 13 would be given a grade. That was because those years and those grades were gateway qualifications, and they were points of movement in the education system. Therefore, it was really important for those students that they were not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they would do next. Actually, they could make sure that their standards were maintained by actually having that modulation across that UK. So, the children could have real confidence.", "relevant_text_span": [["64", "65"]]}, {"query": "What's specific about the elements of coursework that were externally verified?", "answer": "According to Kirsty, children might well have done lots of oral exams in their English and in their Welsh language. Therefore, they had lots of pieces of work that would have been externally verified. They certainly would ensure that these concerns were passed on. Their job was to make the decision on the examinations on the basis of having confidence that what could be put in places was fair and was equitable, and they had the confidence that they would be the case.", "relevant_text_span": [["67", "68"]]}, {"query": "Had the universities across the UK indicated that they were content with the approach going forward?", "answer": "The answer was positive. The views of university and how university terms might be impacted was one of the ways and one of the reasons that they had factored in to making these decisions. The discussions with universities were ongoing. The conversations would continue as they work through the practicalities of how the gradings that were awarded were going to feed through into university admissions decisions and enrollment.", "relevant_text_span": [["79", "81"]]}, {"query": "Summarize the discussion about issues related to the potential closures of colleges and universities.", "answer": "According to Kirsty, they had been very impressed with the maturity and forward-planning that had been adopted by all of those institutions and their representative bodies. They had got consistency in the approach and a common desire, and investment in moving towards online support for students. There was still a safety net idea. Colleges had indicated, as with schools, that, for the most vulnerable learners, they would have something in place that might permit attendance on an individual basis. Any Welsh Government support going to stay, whatever the circumstances were. They would do their best to ensure that there would be no disruption to EMA.", "relevant_text_span": [["82", "113"]]}, {"query": "What sort of conversations were they having with FE and HE at the moment about how they decide the closures?", "answer": "Kirsty believed that universities were autonomous institutions - a status that they guarded jealously and they would never want to question. Colleges were in a similar position, looking to do as much as they could to provide continuity of learning via distance learning methods, and the Bill, potentially, did give them more powers of intervention in both the FE and the HE sector.", "relevant_text_span": [["83", "94"]]}, {"query": "What were their opinions on support or changes of circumstances?", "answer": "Actually, they did not anticipate any change in the approach to students. Individual student circumstances could well change and their expectation would be that the Student Loans Company would respond to that. There would undoubtedly in some cases be really typical challenges to service delivery, simply because organizations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they were reacting to social-distancing messages from the Government. They instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease, not least because a number of institutions had campuses and activities in China and other parts of south-east Asia. And so, as the disease had progressed, they had seen lessons being learned from the support for students who were in isolation coming from there to the UK.", "relevant_text_span": [["102", "108"]]}, {"query": "What's their attitude towards the question whether students might need to be refunded some of their tuition fees?", "answer": "In Huw's opinion, there were lessons that would need to be taken on board. There were established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to enable the tutors and other supporters to make sure that that material meets their needs. The intention in all of these institutions was that they would complete their course of study. Therefore, they were confident that that system would be robust and would make sure that the students were getting a course of learning that met their needs.", "relevant_text_span": [["109", "113"]]}, {"query": "Summarize the discussion about problems and related advices concerning vulnerable learners.", "answer": "According to Kirsty, this was a really worrying time for children and young people. For schools and institutions, they had the formal NHS counselling services to the check-ins. They were concerned that for some children, their access to their counselling was via their school. They knew that and they were just double checking the capacity of online counseling that already existed - online counselling tools that children already used because they did not want to go to the counsellor in the school and be seen in the school corridor going to the counsellor.", "relevant_text_span": [["114", "123"]]}, {"query": "What considerations were they giving to how that mental health and well-being might be supported through what was an incredibly difficult time for everyone?", "answer": "During a prolonged period of closure, they had to acknowledge was what they were looking at\u2014they would expect school staff\u2014well-being staff, for instance in school\u2014to be doing check-ins\u2014phone check-ins, potentially, or FaceTime check-ins, with students, just to keep in touch with them as we go forward. They would be looking to promote amongst young people a range of online facilities that were available\u2014so, for instance, Meic website\u2014so, looking to use a variety of platforms.", "relevant_text_span": [["114", "115"]]}, {"query": "Why did they want to keep schools going as long as possible?", "answer": "Because that routine of going into school and that normality was one that they had needed and wanted to maintain. They needed to understand, and Kirsty thought that they would also have to recognize, that this support would have to be ongoing once they were back to normal, and they would have to continue to look to support children in the longer term who would have lived through this experience. They were incredibly resilient, and they had been the champions of some of our public health messages. They were so much better and so much more compliant on the whole 'washing your hands' and things like that than even adults have been.", "relevant_text_span": [["115", "116"]]}, {"query": "With regard to the national youth voluntary service, would the support and funds be able to be maintained even if settings had to be shut as well?", "answer": "According to Kirsty, no formal decision had been made. They were facing unprecedented circumstances. The normal rules had to change and, those organizations, they would need them to be providing youth services for children when they were back to normal, and they wouldn't want to do anything that would undermine their ability to do that.

Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee this morning. I've received apologies for absence from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian, and I'm very pleased to welcome Helen Mary Jones, who is substituting for Si\u00e2n today. Can I ask whether Members want to declare any interests, please? Can I just, then, place on record that I have got a son who was about to do A-levels, so is affected by the exam decision? We'll move on, then, to our substantive item today, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government around the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on education in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, who is director of the education directorate; Huw Morris, who is the group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning; and Rob Orford, who is the chief scientific adviser for health. Thank you all for coming. We know that this is a really difficult and pressurised time for everyone, and we appreciate your attendance. Minister, I understand you wanted to make an opening statement today."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, if that's okay, Chair. As you know, it's not usually my practice to do that, but I think it is important today. COVID-19 coronavirus is one of the most significant issues that the Welsh Government and the people of Wales have dealt with in recent times. Dealing with the impacts of this pandemic is extremely challenging. Things are changing on an hourly basis, and we have to make decisions quickly to ensure public safety. But I would like to assure you that our aim, and my aim, and my main concern as the education Minister is to protect all staff and pupils in our schools and other educational settings. But we also have a duty to ensure continuing and continuity of education. Public health is clearly the priority here, but that does not change our belief that no child should miss out on any education, unless absolutely necessary. So, the decision to close all schools from tomorrow for statutory education provision was not taken lightly, but I believe it was necessary, given the advice and recommendations that we had received from a public health perspective and the situation that was developing on the ground. From next week, schools will have a new purpose. They will help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak, and I'm working with my colleagues in the Cabinet, with Government officials and our partners in local government to develop and finalise these plans. The key areas that we're looking at are supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning. This includes all of those who benefit from free school meals and children with additional learning needs. I can confirm that all maintained schools in Wales already have access to a range of digital tools that can support distance learning through the world-class Hwb\u00a0digital learning platform, including virtual classrooms and video-conferencing facilities. A guide on what tools are available and how schools can use them has been developed and is being promoted widely. Yesterday, I announced that, whilst there are no easy choices, we have agreed that the best way forward is not to proceed with the summer exam series. Learners due to sit these exams will be awarded a fair grade to recognise their work, drawing on a range of information that is available, and I will announce further details shortly, but I felt it necessary to give early certainty to students and to staff. I would like to put on record my thanks to everyone working in education settings for the hard work that they have put in over the last few months in dealing with the virus and ensuring that pupils have been able to continue to learn. We need to continue to do this work together, as we face the continuing challenges posed by the coronavirus. Diolch yn fawr."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you very much, Minister, for that statement. We'll go to questions from Members now, and I've got some questions from Dawn Bowden."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. Can I thank you, Kirsty, for your statement and the really difficult decisions that you've been having to make? You've already indicated in your statement this morning that these decisions are not taken lightly, and we understand that that is the case across Government. So, thank you for what you've been doing. You've outlined a little bit further there in your statement to us this morning about the new purpose. I take from what you're saying that you haven't really developed that yet in terms of exactly what that is going to look like. You've talked about the children of key workers, free school meals, additional learning needs. Is there anything else you can tell us about that at the moment and how you might staff the schools in those particular areas?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Thank you, Dawn. So, you're\u00a0absolutely right, our priority now is to operationalise, with colleagues in local government and schools, a practical response. And I have to say, we're working to timescales that I would have hoped to have avoided, but given the fact that we're having to make these decisions quite quickly, I hope that you will understand that perhaps where we start on Monday might change when we have more time and more opportunities to develop programmes going forward. Steve will be able to give you more details of the practical work that has already been going on, but our expectation will be that schools will be playing an important part in providing safe and secure places for children of those on the front-line response to dealing with the coronavirus to attend, and work is already under way with local authorities and individual schools on what that will look like for the emergency situation on Monday. Our other priority is indeed free school meals, and, again, where we eventually end up might be a different place to where we are on Monday. Again, we're responding to the emergency situation that there will be families that were expecting a free school meal on Monday, and, again, individual schools and local authorities are developing those plans at pace to be able to provide an emergency response as we work out a longer term plan to deal with the situation. The same thing also goes for additional learning needs, and attending to the needs of that particular group of learners. So, those conversations began a few days ago. I had the opportunity to meet with the First Minister and Andrew Morgan, the leader of the Welsh Local Government Association, yesterday to talk about what local government could do, and what they were already doing. Those plans in some places are already quite developed, and are now working at pace, but I hope you will understand that where we start on Monday is the emergency response, and that work will develop as we go forward. But, Steve, perhaps you could\u2014? Because Steve was the one making all those phone calls and doing the practical operational stuff, rather than me. Steve."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "In short, the new purpose is to meet the needs of particular groups of children and young people. In some cases, some of the response to supporting free school meals, in the short term in particular, we may use the schools as part of that, and I'm certain that will happen in some cases. The second area is looking at how we support the children of key workers. Now, there is still work to be done on identifying exactly the categories of key workers, but I think it's really encouraging that in my discussions yesterday\u2014I spoke with all 22 directors of education, and the examples we're picking up in their work with schools is they're already ahead of the curve in working with schools. So, schools have identified the number of children with health workers. It will grow, and we will need to look at that range. Then, the third area is vulnerable children. They're vulnerable sometimes in terms of education other than at school, vulnerable in terms of mental health, and for those children, as well as having an experience that we want to be planned, some have compared it to a snow day, particularly on Monday, when you're putting something together in the short term, but it will not be a formal curriculum that those children would normally go through. So, the range of activities\u2014some will be focused on educational activities, some will be cultural, some will be sporting, and that plan will be developed on the basis of the age range of children, which in some cases may go from extremely young children up to those at the age of 16 in our all-through schools, but there will be a planned set of activities to cater for those children. What we are doing currently\u2014I have staff back at Cathays Park who are in touch and working with directors of education to ensure that schools over the next two days will have been able to identify, at least at the earlier stage, in terms of health workers, the type and numbers of people. There are already schools who have informed us, and local authorities, of their plans for these activities to be starting next week, which is quite amazing, actually, given where we are. But we are expecting, and we're writing to schools today, that during the course of next week, headteachers to be in schools, and with their staff, taking into consideration the health guidance as to which staff should or should not be in, and in that period from next Monday through the two-week period, to Easter, we expect staff to be both planning for delivery post Easter, but also, as I said, building on and reflecting the good practice that's already in place for schools that have engaged in activities, and I'm sure a number of them will be inviting and enabling those children to come in on Monday. So, Monday will be a challenge for some, and not all will be delivering it, but we will be working so that we can get as much as possible delivered for those groups over the next two weeks, and particularly to have resilient programmes post Easter for the groups of children in those three categories that I said."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Those that have been identified. Can I just clarify one thing? One of the identified vulnerable groups would clearly be children on the at-risk register. They would be included."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "Yes, definitely. Vulnerable children, yes."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "In our discussions, we have asked local government to be working with the social services departments and individual schools to identify those children who may be in that situation. We know that, for some children, being at school is part of their safeguarding arrangements, and obviously we will need to be able to respond to those needs."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "I wrote specifically yesterday to all directors of education to be assured that, for those children, the register is up to date and the plans are in place. I'm working with Albert Heaney my colleague, the director for social services, who is meeting with the 22 directors of social services today to look to ensure that we are joined up in ensuring none of these children fall through the gap."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. I've got a supplementary from Hefin, and then Suzy."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "A very quick and simple question: how are you going to communicate this to parents? There's a bigger picture and it's changing all the time, as you said. The Welsh Government have a route to communication. The most helpful thing I've seen is that Public Health Wales have a single website with information regarding the wider issue of the virus. How will this then be cascaded to schools, because there's obviously a time lag? So, have you considered how this is going to be communicated directly to parents?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We're using all of our platforms of communication to get these messages across. So, we're using the more informal methods of communication, but are relying on a systematic approach via individual directors and through to individual schools. Welsh Government already has a dedicated website page with all of the relevant information about coronavirus. We're looking, as quickly as we can, to have a frequently asked education questions page that we can update. Understandably, people are communicating to us on Twitter asking questions. It is impossible for the communications team here to be able to respond individually to every single person that is sending Facebook messages and sending tweets, so the best way we can do that is to collate the types of questions people are asking and then to be able to have a frequently updated question and answer page to try to respond to that. With regard to parents, for instance, we're aware of schools that have already sent a questionnaire out last night to parents saying, 'Do you consider yourself to be a key worker? Do you work in the NHS? Please let us know by tomorrow so we can put arrangements in place for your children.' So, schools are already taking the initiative and having those conversations with parents about what their needs will be. And, as I said, Hefin, will it be perfect on Monday? No. It won't be perfect by Monday, because we're working to such constrained timescales. But we will continue to build that resilience. We also have to think about systems that look at what might the epidemic do and have systems of resilience that may work next week, given the situation we find ourselves in with public health advice at the moment. But that public health advice may change. Therefore, have we got a system that will be resilient in those circumstances? These are some of the challenges that we're having to grapple with. So, as I said, what happens on Monday might look very different to where we are if schools are still off in May. So, I hope people will understand that we are working in those kinds of scenarios."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Suzy, you had a supplementary."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, just on this question of vulnerable children, I'm just wondering how much discretion teachers are going to have in including individual children who may not be obviously under social services' care or on a risk register or whatever. Teachers know their pupils and, very sensitively, they could include people who may not be obviously in need."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We would absolutely respect the professional judgment of individual headteachers to be able to have those conversations with their directors. As you said, quite rightly, they are the individuals who know their children best and know which children, perhaps, will need this extra support. We will put no constraints on those teachers trying to do that work."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. The second part of my question is: there were going to be Easter holidays anyway, weren't there? What was going to happen about free-school-meal children during that period? Has that gone out of the window now, the normal holiday provision for children? Because that's not there normally, is it, except in separate\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We do find ourselves in a strange situation. My understanding is what we're trying to work to is that we would have ongoing provision and not to make some strange, 'You get this for two weeks, then you don't get it for two weeks, and then you're back in.' My understanding is, in England, that is what they're going to do. We're trying to create a system where it will be seamless and it will not necessarily matter that two of those weeks were formally holidays. It won't matter to those nurses and doctors who will need to be in work during those weeks. We're trying to create a system that will run uniformly. That's our policy goal at the moment."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Helen Mary."}, {"speaker": "Helen Mary Jones AM", "content": "Just briefly, building on Suzy's question, one particular group of children and young people that I hope will be eligible to be included in the potentially vulnerable category is young carers. For some of them, they may not be able to come into school because the people they're caring for may have to be excluded because of their conditions. But I think that, for other young carers, coming to school is an absolute lifeline, because they're working at home. So, I don't know if it's appropriate for you to specifically mention those in discussions with local authorities, but it's a group of young people who, again, may not be vulnerable in other ways, but because of their caring responsibilities they may need school. And the other group\u2014and this, I suppose, goes back to Suzy's point about teachers knowing their young people\u2014is the children who may be living in situations where they're at risk of witnessing domestic abuse. Again, these may very well not be children who are in any formal contact with social services, but being at home may be really not a good place for them to be. So, again, I'd put in an appeal for that to be something that perhaps can be raised with schools. If a teacher is worried about what a child's circumstances are like at home, whether they can be, as you said, Kirsty, included as one of the\u2014. They may not be formally identified, but if the teacher knows that they're at risk, or there is an instinct that they're at risk, they might be able to be included in children who are allowed to take advantage of this special provision you're making at this difficult time."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We will certainly raise those issues. We have to do that in the context of what is deliverable, and we also have to do that in the context of the public health advice that we are receiving as well. One of the reasons why schools are closing is to help manage this disease. We know that the ability for school closures to make a contribution to that diminishes if we have significant children in school still. So, we will take these issues into consideration, but remembering this is part of an epidemic mitigation plan. Rob is the expert on that, not me."}, {"speaker": "Rob Orford", "content": "Yes, absolutely. This is a rapidly-evolving problem and the scale is something that we haven't seen in 100 years, and so we're having to evolve and iterate things as we go. Next week, I think, will look different to this week. So, it kind of is what it is. We've all got a role to play, and schools certainly have a significant role to play in breaking those chains of transmission. Areas that we're worried about are displacement activities. If we close the schools, then people collect at others' houses. We need to send a really clear message that you're all part of the solution, and the things that you do by distancing yourselves from your friends and your family are really important for us to get on top of this outbreak. The more that we can do that, the easier it will be when we go forward."}, {"speaker": "Helen Mary Jones AM", "content": "I'm sure that that's true, but I'm sure that we wouldn't be wanting a child who's in a very pressured environment with perhaps a very difficult relationship between mum and dad\u2014. It may be very important for those children to be out of that for some of the time. Hopefully, we're talking about relatively small numbers, but I just\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We will look at vulnerability in a holistic way."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Janet, you had a supplementary."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair, and good morning, Minister, and your team. Can I just put on record my thanks for all that you're having to endure at this moment? I think it's fair to say you have the support of Assembly Members and, indeed, our communities. Now, the question I have: if Cylch Meithrin have to close, where will they get money from to pay their staff? Because, currently, thankfully, there's support for businesses."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Janet, we're not doing Cylch Meithrin at the moment; we are sticking with schools, as we discussed in advance. Dawn."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Can I just get some clarity, Steve, around what you were saying in terms of next week? Because I think the practical applications of this\u2014and I understand that you don't know all of this yet, I understand that\u2014the practical applications are what is coming to us, obviously, with constituents saying, 'Well, what's going to happen to that?' Just so that I can be clear, are you saying that, at this stage, every headteacher will be in school on Monday, as will all their staff?"}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "Within the scope of the guidance in terms of their health, the expectation\u2014and this will be conveyed in letters by the Minister today, to be made clear\u2014is that they are closing for the majority of pupils, but our expectation within the guidance is that the headteacher with their staff will be coming in; for some to start the delivery of what we just described, but that will probably be small numbers, but more importantly to plan to ensure that, after the formal Easter period, which is school holidays, the schools are geared to cater for the range of pupils that we've been discussing."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "So, would you anticipate\u2014again, I know this is all a bit 'if and when', and it depends on the changing nature of the advice, but from what you're saying, I think we can probably anticipate that, as we go forward, there will probably be fewer schools opening and operable\u2014that we may be moving those children on to fewer sites. Would that possibly\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "That is a potential. So, we already know that one of our local authorities already has identified a strategic pattern of schools that they will want to operate in this way. That local authority has already chosen those locations, and is already having communications with how they will then staff those centres. So, that could well\u2014. That, I expect, in the longer term, will be the nature of the provision that we will get to. But that's not for us to dictate. The local authorities are best placed to understand what is the best, pragmatic use of the resources that they have available; and of course those resources, primarily, are human beings. So, we've talked a lot this morning in the context of teaching staff, teaching assistants, but we're also having discussions with local authorities, and I met with the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services this week, to look at deploying youth workers, to look to be deploying other staff that the local authority may employ, like sports development officers. There may be cultural officers that can have something to offer. Welsh Government will be talking with a range of our partners who perhaps their normal activities can't continue at the moment, but actually have personnel who want to add to this effort, who want to be able to be part of a provision going forward in the longer term, to be able to provide a great place for children to be. We want to give parents, who we are asking\u2014. Let's think about it, in these worst of times, we're asking parents to leave their children so that they can go and do essential work, and some of that essential work is putting themselves at risk, potentially. And we want to give those parents confidence that, when they leave their child with us, that child will receive something really worthwhile, and they can direct all of their attention to doing their job."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Just before you\u2014. Janet, have you got a supplementary on schools now, not on early years settings?"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "I lost the signal before, so it's a little bit confusing at this end, so bear with me. Just in terms of the closure of schools, I have been asked by teachers what does new purpose\u2014you may have covered it, but bear in mind [Inaudible.]\u2014mean in practice. And also, they're already asking what will next\u2014? I know you said earlier that next week could look and probably will look significantly different than this week, but what can they expect to be happening next week in terms of this new purpose work?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "We've covered that, Janet."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "First of all, Janet, I just want to say thank you very much for your kind comments. That's really, really kind of you. We will be sending a letter today to clarify those positions. So, each school will receive letters today about the expectations of schools next week."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "I think you're having trouble hearing us, aren't you, so I think\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "No, I heard that loud and clear."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "But I think you missed the earlier comments, when we went into some detail on the new purpose of schools. So, I'm sorry about that; we are having some problems with the connection."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Yes, we couldn't get a signal."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Dawn."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Just in relation to special schools and how they will fit into this new purpose arrangement."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, they're absolutely central to that planning. We know, again, that some of these children are our most vulnerable and they are some of our most pressurised families. Therefore, the same situation that we've just described for maintained schools also applies to special schools. We'll be having discussions about what arrangements can be made for those children within their own usual settings. In some cases, that may not be possible. So, again, already local authorities are making different provision. Can I give a shout out to the work of Rhondda Cynon Taf in this regard, who are already doing some excellent work with regard to how they can keep in touch with their children who usually would attend their special schools. But, again, Steve can give more detail."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "I think special schools have already been hit by this challenge, because a significant proportion of their children, because of their conditions, have not been coming to school, they've been isolated. But the principle we've used there is, actually, even if it's a minority of children who go to those schools and are vulnerable, they deserve and need that support through the school. So, we would expect that to function with the focus on vulnerable children. But similarly, even in special schools, there will be children whose parents will be key workers, so we would expect them to apply that same principle. Just quickly in response to the earlier question, while we may bring some groups of children into separate schools, we\u2019ll have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely, given the nature of the special school, so we would look to cater for that within the original school."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Just a couple more questions from me. It\u2019s likely, because I know it has already happened, that some schools might actually close before Monday. Some schools have already partially closed. Are you quite happy that headteachers still have the discretion to do that, if they feel that\u2019s the right thing to do?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "In this situation, the discretion of the head still remains. As I said, we will be communicating with all schools today about our expectations, if at all possible, to have schools open for staff to do some of this planning and to be able to respond to these priority needs that we've just talked about."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "The rationale of headteachers for closing schools up to now has been that they can't cope with the safety of the children. I think, moving forward, it's unlikely that that would be a rationale that headteachers would want to use for not engaging and planning for the future."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "We're only talking about one more day, now, anyway, aren't we? So, just in terms of confirmed cases in schools, is your view at this stage that, if there is a confirmed case in a school, once that school has been deep-cleaned, it can reopen again?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "If we had a confirmed case in a school, then all the usual mechanisms arranged by Public Health Wales would kick in at that point."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. And my final question is in relation to the position of early years and childcare settings. I know that kind of crosses over into somebody else's portfolio as well, but I think we know that. Certainly what I've seen, and I'm sure this is true elsewhere as well, we've seen nurseries closing down because the parents are actually taking the children out of those nurseries. I've got one in particular, there are kids from the ages of 6 to 12 years in there, and the parents are taking them out. They've got 30 staff there, catering for 200 children and no children to care for and the organisation, at this stage, is unable to claim on their insurance for the ongoing payment of those staff wages. Is there any advice that we can give to people in that situation at this stage?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Sure. As you say, many of these settings are businesses\u2014people's businesses and they play a hugely important role and it's a very worrying time for them. We have said that we will continue to pay for childcare, delivered under the childcare offer even when a child is unable, or a parent is unwilling, to take up that place. So, if that setting is receiving a childcare payment from the Welsh Government as part of our childcare offer, that will be paid, regardless of whether that child attends or not. And I know that we're also working with local authorities to ensure a similar position on Flying Start childcare and early education. So, that payment will be made, regardless of whether a child is attending. It's also important that childcare settings will be able to apply for the various packages of support that are being made available by my colleague, Ken Skates."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Hefin, then Janet."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Yes, I'd just like to turn that around from the parents' point of view. With schools closing, there are a lot of parents then losing 10 hours of free childcare, but from a settings point of view, they'll continue to be able to receive, for the time being, the nursery care."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, so the decision that has been taken by my colleague, Julie Morgan, is that settings should stay open at the moment unless public health changes. That's being kept under constant review on public health. Again, the issue is that we know that that childcare is vital to many families, especially\u2014and we're particularly concerned about those individuals who are trying to help us overcome and solve these problems. If you have any specific questions about that, we'll be happy to take them back to Julie Morgan."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Janet."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Is this the Cylch question?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Yes, please."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Sorry, thank you. Yes, just basically, Cylch Meithrin, there are concerns\u2014[Interruption.]"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "We've lost Janet. We'll come back to her."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think if the issue is about funding for Cylch Meithrin, these are not normal circumstances. As a Welsh Government, we will take every step to provide continuity of funding, if at all possible. We will overcome this, and when we overcome this situation we find ourselves in, we will need those childcare settings, we will need those private businesses and we will need our Cylch Meithrin to be there to respond and to be able to go on doing the job that they usually do for us. And if there is any way that we can, as a Government, ensure that that happens by carrying on funding things, even if they are not able to run, all usual\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014 around service-level agreements are off. I'm not setting the precedent\u2014let me make that absolutely clear. [Laughter.] But, you know, we will not undermine businesses and voluntary provision like Cylch by withdrawing Welsh Government funding. I hope I've been clear."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you for that."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you, Kirsty."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "If we can move on to talk about exams, obviously you made the announcement yesterday. I completely understand that everything is a very fast-moving situation, but, as you know, there are a lot of questions that people have about young people who've put a lot of work in. Are you able to tell us any more today? In particular, have you got any idea about timescales now for setting out what the approach will be to handling the lack of summer exams?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, it is a devastating decision to have to have been taken, but I have done so on the very, very clear and unambiguous advice from Qualifications Wales. I met with Qualifications Wales and the WJEC yesterday. What was most important to them was that I made an early decision and I did not equivocate on what would happen for the exams. I was able to make an informal decision at that meeting, and then, of course, there is a formal process that we have to go through. That, now, allows Qualifications Wales and the exam board to operationalise that decision, and they will be communicating with schools as quickly as possible about what schools will need to do to ensure that the systems that they will now put in place can work. We are trying, as far as we can, as I understand it, to be able to mirror as closely as possible the usual results day, for instance. It might not be possible, because, of course, we're dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it, and those human beings could find themselves unwell. So, our best attempts will be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exams day in August, but that has to be caveated by the fact that we're dealing with difficult circumstances. But, the WJEC and Qualifications Wales will be making urgent communications to exam centres to explain what will need to happen next."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Janet, you had a question on this."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Yes, I think I raised it yesterday, Kirsty, but you were receiving loads of questions. I'd just ask for some further clarification about coursework, because only 30 per cent of that is done. Years 11 and 13, typically, in my case they're what's been raised with me\u2014do you have any advice for them?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay, so, all exams are cancelled, but year 11 and year 13 will be given a grade\u2014I think that's a distinction that people need to be aware of. That is because those years and those grades are gateway qualifications, and they are points of movement in the education system. So, it's really important for those students that they are not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they will do next, whether that be university, whether that be a degree apprenticeship or whether that be going into sixth form, into a college, into an apprenticeship or into some work-based learning opportunities. That's why we have to focus on those children, because for them, it is absolutely critical that we do. We are at an advantage in Wales, can I say? Because of the nature of our examination system, those students already have a lot of externally assessed work that we can use as a basis to move forward on. Because we've kept our AS-levels, we have got that data. Because we have a GCSE system\u2014. Our year 11s, if they're doing triple science, they've already done 40 per cent of their paper, so we're very fortunate. Because of the structures that we have got in our qualification system, there is already lots and lots of externally-verified work that we can use, alongside, potentially, teacher evaluation of students as well. And I think that's really important. We\u2019re starting from a better base than simply having none of that externally-verified data. What will also be important is that these children have confidence in those qualifications, and so we will be looking at a modulated arrangement within Wales, and I know that Qualifications Wales are discussing with their counterparts across the UK a modulated system across the UK. So, actually, we can make sure that our standards are maintained by actually having that modulation across the UK. So, we know that those children never have to worry about the rigour that has gone into determining that grade. So, they can have real confidence."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Helen Mary."}, {"speaker": "Helen Mary Jones AM", "content": "Thank you. A supplementary question that might feed into that moderation. You'll know that the National Union of Students has suggested that black and minority ethnic children and children from the working class, on the whole, don't do as well, in terms of their assessment by their own teachers. I don't know what their evidence is for that. We also know, of course, that boys tend to do better in exams, and girls tend to do better at coursework, for whatever reason\u00a0that is. So, just to ask you at this early stage to build in those considerations around potential unconscious bias into that overall system that you're talking about. And, of course, you are right to say that, because we have got some elements of external moderation here, those factors may be less for us in Wales than they might for colleagues in England."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, I think we are starting at a different base, thank goodness. So, you're quite right. As I said, students will have done unit 1 papers last year if they're GCSE students. Dare I say it, some might even have done early entry. So, we still have elements of coursework that are externally verified. So, children might well have done lots of oral exams in their English and in their Welsh language. So, we have lots of pieces of work that will have been externally verified. I certainly will ensure that these concerns are passed on. I'm sure that Qualifications Wales are thinking about it. I have every confidence that they and the WJEC will come up with a very comprehensive way of establishing those grades, but I have to say, in some ways, I have to step back now, because you would not expect me, in normal circumstances, to dictate to the WJEC how much percentage goes for that, and how much percentage is allocated for that; that would not be appropriate for a Minister. My job is to make the decision on the examinations on the basis of having confidence that what can be put in place is fair and is equitable, and I have confidence that that will be the case."}, {"speaker": "Helen Mary Jones AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Suzy."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "A few things from me. One is, obviously, pupils are being asked to work at home as well now, some of whom will be doing GCSE and A-level courses. So, there's just a question, generally, from me\u2014 because we're encouraging these kids to carry on working\u2014how that will be accommodated by Qualifications Wales, I guess, in this modulation process. It may be that your at-home work will be of a higher standard or a lower standard than a teacher would be expecting. Secondly, you mentioned the AS-levels, of course, as being of value at the moment, but we've got people in Year 12 who now won't be doing their ASs. Is there any steer at this stage about what they will be expected to do? Will they be doing two sets of exams next year, for example? Or is AS just off the table? In which case, how are the A2s going to be calculated in due course? And then, finally from me, we do have some vocational qualifications that are up for examination as well\u2014your BTECs, and I think it's the Association of Accounting Technicians, which is a lot of computer-based learning\u2014which is due to be examined within three weeks. Those aren\u2019t A-levels or GCSEs. I appreciate that you may not have the answer just at the moment, but are they off as well is the question, I guess?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "With regard to\u00a0AS-levels\u2014no final decision has been made for exactly how those students will be treated. There are a range of options that could be used, but again, we will want to be thinking about student well-being, fairness and equity in that regard, and I will update Members as soon as I have received definitive advice from Qualifications Wales around that, and that hasn't happened yet. With regard to other types of qualifications, as you will be aware, the vast majority of BTECs is a modular, continually-assessed piece of work, and we would have every expectation that BTECs will be able to be awarded, but clearly, those conversations are with awarding bodies\u2014they tend to be UK awarding bodies, rather then necessarily our WJEC exam board\u2014and those conversations are ongoing. But I have every expectation that those qualifications will be awarded and, of course, because of their nature there's even more evidence of continued assessment. Huw, I don't know if there's anything else that you would like to add about those types of qualifications."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "No. I think you've covered most of it. I don't have a definitive answer for the ATT qualification, but we can look into that and come back to you."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, I've just had a constituent ask, so that would be very helpful. And homeworking\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Homeworking, right."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "\u2014is that going to count towards the assessments, overall assessments?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, potentially, as I said. I don't know the exact elements. What will be absolutely necessary is that Qualifications Wales and the WJEC will be able to give absolute clarity and simplicity around how those grades will be arrived at, because parents, teachers and students will want to know that, and my expectation is on them to be able to clearly communicate what elements will and will not be taken into consideration when awarding those grades."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "That's great. At least we covered it. Thank you, Minister\u2014thank you, Kirsty."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "And, just before we move on, have the universities across the UK indicated that they are content with this approach going forward\u2014content to accept students on this basis?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Certainly. There have been discussions with universities and UCAS, of course, that this also has a bearing on. One of the\u2014. And the views of university and how university terms might be impacted is one of the ways and one of the reasons that we've factored in to making these decisions. Those discussions with universities are ongoing, aren't they, Huw?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "Yes. So, we've been in regular conversation with Universities Wales and through them with Universities UK and we've received every indication that the approach that's been adopted here has been welcomed by the institutions. Those conversations will continue as we work through the practicalities of how the gradings that are awarded are going to feed through into university admissions decisions and enrolment."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Well, we've got some questions now from Suzy on the potential closures of colleges and universities."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Well, it's a very general question, really. I appreciate you've already indicated there are lots of ongoing conversations, but my understanding is whether colleges or universities close is pretty much still at their own discretion. We're going to be asking some questions on emergency legislation shortly, which may impact on the answer you can give today, but what sort of conversations are you having with FE and HE at the moment about how they decide?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, you're absolutely right. As we often say in this committee, universities are autonomous institutions\u2014a status that they guard jealously and we would never want to question. Universities have been making the decision to move as much of their learning online as they possibly can and we continue to have conversations with them. Colleges are in a similar position, looking to do as much as they can to be able to provide continuity of learning via distance learning methods, and the Bill, potentially, does give us more powers of intervention in both the FE and the HE sector."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I might ask you about that in a minute, because I don't even know what the Bill says yet."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Huw, I don't know if there's anything you want to add."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "No\u2014just to confirm what's been said and also to add in that independent training providers, similarly autonomous, like colleges and universities, have been moving in the same direction. We've been very impressed with the maturity and forward-planning that's been adopted by all of those institutions and their representative bodies. We've got consistency in the approach and a common desire, and investment in moving towards online support for students."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "And there's still this safety net idea. Certainly, colleges have indicated, as with schools, that, for the most vulnerable learners, they'll have something in place that might permit attendance on an individual basis."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "That's my understanding, yes, and, again, we've been in regular conversation with them about that. My understanding is that they're going to spend the next week working through the detail of how that will work for the institutions."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "That's fair enough. And, presumably, education maintenance allowance will still be paid."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes. Arrangements have been made to ensure that EMA continues to be paid to all students who are entitled."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "That's right. You indicated that any Welsh Government support's going to stay, whatever the circumstances are\u2014in your portfolio."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes. I'm doing my best, but it's an absolute yes on the EMA. There will be no disruption to EMA."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. You might get some further questions on HE and FE."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Yes. We've got some further questions, indeed, from Helen Mary and then Hefin."}, {"speaker": "Helen Mary Jones AM", "content": "Now or in a bit?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Helen Mary Jones AM", "content": "Just further to EMA, of course, at the moment, that has an attendance qualification, doesn't it? And you don't get your EMA if you don't turn up. Should we take from your last answer that that attendance qualification doesn't apply anymore?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes. They can't turn up if the institution is not open, and that's not their fault."}, {"speaker": "Helen Mary Jones AM", "content": "No, but that is something that's been a worry, so that's really encouraging to hear. Thinking about students in higher education, can you give an assurance that student maintenance payments will continue as normal? Is that the intention?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Helen Mary Jones AM", "content": "That's really good to hear. And have you given any special ministerial instruction to Student Finance Wales on processing applications for support or changes of circumstances, or is that something that's kind of ongoing at the moment?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Those conversations are ongoing with the Student Loans Company. As I said, we anticipate no disruption to\u2014. We don't anticipate any change in the approach to students as a result of this. Individual student circumstances could well change and our expectation would be that the Student Loans Company would respond to that. All I would say is, just to remind people: people who work for the Student Loans Company are no more able to resist this disease than anybody else. There will undoubtedly in some cases be really practical challenges to service delivery, simply because organisations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they are reacting to social-distancing messages from the Government. So, I think we just need to bear that in mind: that these organisations are doing their best, but, if they are badly affected by staff numbers being off because of the virus, then I hope people will give them due consideration."}, {"speaker": "Helen Mary Jones AM", "content": "Yes, that makes sense, of course, because we've been told that universities won't be able to entirely close, because there will be students who can't go home\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "It is their home."}, {"speaker": "Helen Mary Jones AM", "content": "\u2014overseas students, for example. What discussions have you been having with the sector to make sure that those students' basic needs are met, that there's still food, shelter, whatever they need?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, obviously, universities have a duty of care to those students that find themselves in those circumstances, and every conversation that Huw's been having would suggest that universities are well aware of their need to do that."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "We instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease, not least because a number of institutions have campuses and activities in China and other parts of south-east Asia. And so, as the disease has progressed, we've seen lessons being learned from the support for students who are in isolation coming from there to the UK, and I am assured that the universities here in Wales have got processes in place that support those learners."}, {"speaker": "Helen Mary Jones AM", "content": "That's really helpful. And on this specifically\u2014last question from me\u2014 have you considered whether students might need to be refunded some of their tuition fees, should the academic year not be completed?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "So, as the institutions move more and more of their material and some of their assessment online, clearly, there are lessons that will need to be taken on board. There are established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to enable the tutors and other supporters to make sure that that material meets their needs. The intention in all of these institutions is that they will complete their course of study. There are appeals mechanisms and feedback mechanisms through the students union and through course committees and other things within institutions to make sure that any concerns or incomplete work are addressed. Failing those institutional mechanisms, there is a UK-wide system through the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for students to take forward any concerns that they have. So, we're confident that that system will be robust and will make sure that the students are getting a course of learning that meets their needs."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Suzy, you had a supplementary."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "No, Mr Morris has answered my question."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. We've got a couple more questions now on vulnerable learners. I've got Helen Mary, then Hefin."}, {"speaker": "Helen Mary Jones AM", "content": "I think, Chair, the Minister has already answered what the\u2014. But thinking just a little bit more broadly about the mental health and well-being of staff and learners across a range of educational settings, or, indeed, young people who can't access educational settings, what considerations are you giving to how that mental health and well-being might be supported through what is an incredibly difficult time for everyone?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, that is correct. So, our expectation would be that during a prolonged period of closure\u2014which I think, if we're honest, we have to acknowledge is what we're looking at\u2014we would expect school staff\u2014well-being staff, for instance in school\u2014to be doing check-ins\u2014phone check-ins, potentially, or FaceTime check-ins, with students, just to keep in touch with them as we go forward. We'll be looking to promote amongst young people\u00a0a range of online facilities that are available\u2014so, for instance, Meic website\u2014so, looking to use a variety of platforms. We do, of course, have the formal NHS counselling services. I'm concerned, of course, that for some children their access to their counsellor is\u00a0via their school. We know that, and we're just double checking the capacity of online counselling that already exists\u2014online counselling tools that children already use because they don't want to go to the counsellor in the school and be seen in the school corridor going to the counsellor. They're already using those online methods and we expect to be able to continue, as far as possible, those kinds of mechanisms where children can have their mental health needs and their questions answered, and their worries. I think we have to remember that this is a really worrying time for children and young people. One of the reasons, again, that we wanted to keep schools going as long as possible\u2014and teachers have been working so hard to do that\u2014is because that routine of going into school and that normality is one that we've needed and wanted to maintain. Children will have worries about their own health; they'll have worries about the health of their parents and their grandparents; they will be consuming potentially media and news stories that have empty supermarket shelves. So, we need to understand, and I think we will also have to recognise, that this support will have to be ongoing once we're back to normal, and we will have to continue to look to support children in the longer term who will have lived through this experience. They are incredibly resilient, and they have been the champions of some of our public health messages. They are so much better and so much more compliant on the whole 'washing your hands' and things like that than even adults have been. So, they are incredibly resilient, but we also have to recognise that it can be a really worrying time for them."}, {"speaker": "Helen Mary Jones AM", "content": "Can I just\u2014? Just a supplementary to that\u2014you've mentioned already, Kirsty, the importance of youth services, and, particularly thinking voluntarily youth services, you've given the commitment, when were talking about Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin earlier, that services that are part-funded by grants through the Welsh Government, for example, thinking of the national youth voluntary service\u2014will those be able to be maintained even if settings have had to be shut as well? Obviously, local authorities will have to make their own decisions about whether youth settings are kept open, but, in terms of the direct support from Welsh Government, can organisations that receive it rely on that through this time?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No formal decision has been made, but if people are in receipt of a Government grant from my department to run a service and that service can no longer run because of the public\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Helen Mary Jones AM", "content": "Because it's not safe."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "\u2014because it's not safe to do so, I do not foresee that we will be turning around and saying, 'We'll have our money back, thank you very much.'"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Helen Mary Jones AM", "content": "That will make a lot of people happy, thank you. [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "As I said, we are facing unprecedented circumstances. The normal rules of engagement have to change and, those organisations, we'll need them to be providing youth services for children when we are back to normal, and we wouldn't want to do anything that would undermine their ability to do that. Our call to the youth service is a call to arms, though. When we're trying to maintain services for vulnerable children and for front-line staff children, they have a valuable role to play and I know that local government and the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services are already in discussion about how youth services\u2014. Many of our youth services work on an outreach basis. Those traditional youth clubs, because of austerity, are not necessarily there anymore, so they are well used to being out and about and doing outreach work, and they will have an important part to play in the services that we talked about earlier."}, {"speaker": "Helen Mary Jones AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Hefin, briefly, and then we're going to take one final question from Suzy on emergency legislation."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "All right. I'll declare an interest as a parent of a child with additional learning needs, although the question I'm about to ask doesn't reflect her interests. Additional learning needs pupils who are waiting outcomes of referrals\u2014if they're currently waiting an outcome of a referral, will that process will be suspended or will it continue as normal? And, if it is suspended, will it pick up where it left off from this point?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think we have to recognise that the ability to deliver business as usual has been massively compromised. I'm sure people will try and continue to do their normal activities and their normal jobs, but that might not be possible. I will have to check that, Hefin, to be honest. I don't want to give you any false assurance if, actually, the intelligence on the ground is that that simply will not be able to happen. But we don't\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Can we have a clear line on that?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We don't want to jeopardise anybody, but as I said, some of the normal services are simply not available as everybody turns their attention to trying to respond to the pandemic."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Final question\u2014because I know that the Minister's got a lot of things that she needs to get on with\u2014from Suzy on emergency legislation."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I'm not going to ask you if you'll use any powers you get under the emergency legislation, but are you able to give us some indication of what they might be?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Sure. For instance, the Bill will provide Welsh Ministers with powers to temporarily close schools or other educational institutions, childcare premises; powers to give temporary continuity direction\u2014so, actually, the other way around, force things to be open\u2014and to be able to direct resources. So, that includes, as I said, I could direct something to stay open if that institution was trying to close down. The powers also give flexibility to maybe be able to direct staff to other institutions that they would not normally work in, if that was part of our resilience needs. We'd also be looking at, for instance, relaxing requirements around ratios in childcare settings, or we might be wanting to do things around food. So, obviously, we have rules around the level of nutrition that schools should be giving their children. If there is a continuing role for schools in providing food, we might have to be a bit more flexible about what that might look like. So, those kinds of flexibilities\u2014to be able to suspend things, direct things\u2014that we would not normally have in normal circumstances."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. And just to finish this one off\u2014you may not be able to answer this one, in all fairness\u2014in those situations where it's the Government who says 'no' to various things, does that then help people in the situation of Dawn's nursery, and insurance claims suddenly become more likely?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I'm not an expert on insurance, and I don't know if anybody here can help me. But what my understanding is, is that even where Government has given a direction that does not necessarily mean that you will be covered by your insurance. What we're finding in the private sector is that insurance companies are not paying out, because even when a Government has directed it, they do not regard this as a disruption to business. So, the insurance industry is not my area of expertise."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "No, no, I accept that."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "It's not my area of expertise, but from what I understand from discussions around the Cabinet table, this is particularly problematic. Let me give you an example about how we've been trying to overcome some of this\u2014it feels like an awfully long time ago now\u2014 you'll be aware that we gave directions earlier around cancellation of school trips abroad. Trying to make sure that that direction came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, rather than the Department for Education was a real battle, because again there were fears that, unless that advice came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, insurance would not kick in, and that was a two-day discussion."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. This is helpful to know, actually."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "So, these are the kinds of things that we're grappling with. But, as I said, thinking about it, that was only last week, but it feels like an aeon ago."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I'm not holding you to that, but it helps us manage the questions we get asked."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, but as I said, insurance is not my area of expertise."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "No, but thank you for answering."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Well, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank you for attending this morning, and your officials? We do recognise what an incredibly challenging time this is, and we'd like to place on record our thanks to all of you for the work that you're doing to try and see us through this crisis. As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Thank you again, all of you, for your attendance.

To start with, Kirsty Williams AM suggested although the Bill was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, it was still valuable to discuss in the current context. The Act had partly fulfilled the Government's objectives in regulating institutions, safeguarding contribution, managing fair access and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. Kirsty Williams AM also pointed out that new methods should be included to further regulate, co-ordinating and fund the sector. When it comes to the future of the Act, the meeting agreed that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of the civic mission, and students' interests must be fully preserved. Meanwhile, some participants argued that HEFCW's powers were inflexible and fee plans from private providers were hard to regulate. Kirsty Williams AM agreed that a more flexible connection between the regulating sectors and the others should be attained. Besides, the meeting also talked about managing risk and agreed that the Act, in the future should include more alternative providers for students who were receiving long-term support. In the end, Kirsty Williams AM praised the contribution from overseas providers in supporting transnational education in Wales and agreed that rights of students in Wales should always be put in the first place."}], "specific_query_list": [{"query": "What did the meeting discuss about the advantage of the Act?", "answer": "Although highly challenged by the participants, Kirsty Williams AM argued that the Act had fulfilled the Government's objectives in regulating institutions, safeguarding contribution, managing fair access and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. These strategic aims were still really important but in the new situation, it was required to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England. In this case, to continue fulfilling its national outcomes, the Act should evolve by implementing new student support measures.", "relevant_text_span": [["4", "4"]]}, {"query": "What did the meeting discuss about the weakness of the Act?", "answer": "The Act was considered that the legislation itself was not strong enough by Sian Gwenllian AM and Kirsty Williams AM agreed that remit letters were a really important way in which national priorities could be preserved. Moreover, it was stressed that it was important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers' in the Welsh system. In this case, they should be designated on a case-by-case basis and always be able to protect the interests of the students. Besides, Kirsty Williams AM pointed out that the government had not identified an urgent reason to designate different types of courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit, but in fact, the regulation for each type of them did differ from each other.", "relevant_text_span": [["5", "13"], ["19", "19"]]}, {"query": "What had the Act and the Bill already achieved?", "answer": "To answer this question, Kirsty Williams AM first introduced the achievements that the new system of student finance did again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have in the different situations, as a direct result of the changing scenario. Moreover, it was a great success to see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement.", "relevant_text_span": [["22", "22"]]}, {"query": "How could the Act and the Bill be improved?", "answer": "Currently, the government planned to use the remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders' pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, it had been a success to use the remit letter and some funding to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. To conclude, Kirsty Williams AM suggested that the new PCET reforms were aimed to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encouraged collaboration and co-operation across the sector.", "relevant_text_span": [["24", "24"], ["28", "28"]]}, {"query": "What was the current situation about HEFCW's powers of intervention?", "answer": "Dawn Bowden AM challenged that informal measures or actions had been taken in their role as regulator, and Kirsty Williams AM explained that the commission was expected to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which was non-punitive but actually allowed people to participate in it. Meanwhile, Huw Morris suggested that specific mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, etc had been used to hopefully achieve some alignment in the tertiary sector. Also, as a loan-based system of student finance, a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW when things went wrong.", "relevant_text_span": [["34", "40"]]}, {"query": "What did the meeting talk about to control HEFCW's powers of intervention?", "answer": "Huw Morris started by introducing the focus on learning from other nations to track the information flows and help the universities in return. Meanwhile, Kirsty Williams AM suggested a balance to be achieved by each part of the participants. However, Dawn Bowden AM questioned about HEFCW's use of informal measures which might not be as prevalent as they currently are. Kirsty Williams AM answered that it should be remembered that HEFCW would surely be replaced, and a more flexible way would be adopted to control the financial codes of universities to assure the quality of the provision.", "relevant_text_span": [["44", "52"]]}, {"query": "What did Hefin David AM concern about the fee and access plans?", "answer": "To answer Hefin David AM's question, Kirsty Williams AM first stressed that the success of the fee and access plan relied on the understanding of whether an annual basis was an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether a long period was suitable for the Act. Sometimes it was hard to make a final judgment since the futures of the students were unpredictable but the fee and access plans could always be one of the drivers for some of the improvements. In the meantime, constant efforts had been put into communications with  a range of stakeholders to continue developing legislative proposals to assure the fee.", "relevant_text_span": [["58", "68"]]}, {"query": "How did Kirsty Williams AM plan to manage risks?", "answer": "Hefin David AM questioned about the right balance between institutions with the strongest track records that were more highly regulated and those riskier private alternative providers. Kirsty Williams AM argued that more attention should be paid to focus on the inherent quality of those charitable status which was regarded as a key reference point in the operation. Although there were some concerns of some private providers, particularly in England, they should not be treated the same. In this case, the government would regulate them on a course-by-course basis. Moreover, quality provision should be included and alternative providers would be given more attention.", "relevant_text_span": [["77", "86"]]}, {"query": "What did Kirsty Williams AM react in response to concerns of the governance of universities?", "answer": "Kirsty Williams AM first admitted that it was true that the Bill did not directly address issues around governance in the sector. However, establishing a more direct relationship with chairs of universities, especially one-to-one relationships with them, had been attached much importance and it was crucial to help the government understand each aspect of issues in universities. Moreover, ways to make sure that the governing bodies were diverse and it was able to include both student voice as well as the staff voice in governance going forward would be discussed in the future. Kirsty Williams AM stressed that there were plans to engage with each of the governing bodies since the situation was getting far more complex.", "relevant_text_span": [["89", "96"]]}, {"query": "How did Sian Gwenllian AM ask about the quality assurance?", "answer": "Sian Gwenllian AM argued that there was evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provisions in two further education colleges.

However, she explained that the Act was built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompassesed all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. Huw Morris also helped to explain that a lot of joint operation was required during the process and the new Bill would try to make that clearer.", "relevant_text_span": [["102", "105"]]}, {"query": "What did Kirsty Williams AM say about her plan for quality assurance?", "answer": "Kirsty Williams AM shared that the government had listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. And she stressed that the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, effective and comprehensive. Besides, the quality framework should cover higher education to make it compatible with ENQA, which was considered as highly important going forward, since it would be compatible with current UK-wide baseline standards to avoid specific problems for the HE sector in Wales. Although it might cause a stir, a change must be made in the new situation.

I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill that was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration, but I think it is really valuable work in the context of the question you just set out: what can we learn from the implementation of this piece of legislation as we move forward with our reform journey and with this Government and my proposals to introduce a new commission for tertiary education? There is much, at the moment, that lies within the 2015 Act that we will look to bring forward into the new legislation, but there are certainly experiences\u2014and I'm sure we'll come on to some of the evidence that has been received about what's worked, what perhaps hasn't worked\u2014that we all want to reflect on and be mindful of as we take forward the new Bill, including the report of this committee as part of it. So, it is our intention that this Bill will be superceded by the new PCETR Bill."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you.

Where are the weaknesses?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Diolch yn fawr, Si\u00e2n. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. And I think there are a number of ways in which that can happen. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. The remit letters are a really important way in which we can lay out those national priorities. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. That's clear enough. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. So, I think, first of all, it's important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers, and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers' in the Welsh system, as opposed to the English system. And I think that's a really important distinction to make. So, currently, under the current legislation, unregulated providers can only access Welsh Government student support if they're designated on a case-by-case basis. So, we do have a circumstance where\u2014and a process in place, to manage this. So, we have a specific designation policy, which is operated on our behalf by HEFCW. Only six organisations were designated on a case-by-case basis in the 2018-19 academic year, so the scale here is small. Three of those were further education colleges. So, when we talk about a private provider, perhaps people would have a view of a private university, but, actually, three of those were FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. All three of those are actual charities. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality\u2014is what they\u2019re providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn\u2019t viable; as well as their contribution to private\u2014sorry, not to private good\u2014public good. And we are considering how that part of the sector will be regulated in the forthcoming legislation. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we\u2019ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they\u2019re enrolling with are strong and have good quality."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "At this stage\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "\u2014or are you still thinking about it?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. And there are a number of reasons for that. Actually, the current Act\u2014the 2015 Act\u2014does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, clearly, we'll need to keep that under review. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government\u2019s policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding\u2014. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions. Personally,\u00a0I wholeheartedly believe that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of what I'd describe as a civic mission. I'm determined that any legislation that I bring forward and any commission that I establish will be empowered to enable that to happen through its regulatory and funding powers. Of course, the funding situation has shifted again now because of the introduction of what is commonly known as the Diamond reforms, but our new system of student finance does again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have. But, as I said earlier, it's not to say that institutions have had a free reign. We have been able to use the remit letter and our relationship with HEFCW to progress agendas that we would want to see. So, for instance, you'll be aware, in my remit letter, I am concerned about issues around how people working in the sector are paid. We've been able to successfully see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers, all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government's code of ethical procurement. So, it's not to say that the Act has meant that we've had no influence, but there are opportunities now, because of the change in financial circumstances once again, to look at that in any forthcoming legislation."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you, Minister. Do you share HEFCW's views on the benefits of having national targets to get institutions to address national priorities? Is this something you wish you could do?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, it's not something I wish I could do; I think that we're doing it. Self-praise is no recommendation, but, because of the working relationship that we have, I think we're seeing some success in using the remit letter to influence national outcomes. So, I've just talked about living wage; we're also using our remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders' pay, the gender pay gap within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thanks. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms\u2014to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, Janet?"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you\u2014that's great, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use\u2014I think HEFCW called them 'threatening'\u2014saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions\u2014they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible\u2014did you use the word soft\u2014and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from\u2014what did he call it\u2014a 'meeting without coffee' to\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "That's a very HEFCW thing to say."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "\u2014potentially institutions going bankrupt, and there don't seem to be many steps in between that. I'd invite you to say whether you'd like to remedy that in future."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think, as I said at the beginning of the session, this is why this post-legislative scrutiny is useful, because we can reflect on that feedback. As I said, I would expect to be able to ensure that the commission had a range of powers that could address\u2014from that soft power and those early conversations to being able to, as I said, issue, perhaps, advice and guidance to an institution, so there would be a more graduated escalation. Huw, is there anything else that I've missed out?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "Just to build on what the Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information\u2014it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We would hope that's in the direction of the civic university approach that the Minister has outlined. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. When things go badly wrong, there are a range of mechanisms. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "That wasn't how I understood it. I understood it to be the fact that you use these informal powers and then the next step up is quite a severe sanction and there's not much in between those."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "So, in\u2014. Shall I carry on?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Of course, yes."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "In the Hazelkorn review, there's quite a lot of focus on that and looking to learn from other national systems where outcome agreements provide a broader measure of the range of things the institutions do and a mechanism for tracking how things are done through the provision of information back to the institution to help them know how they're doing. And potentially, in some of these other institutions, funding is linked to some of those things."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And, of course, what always has to be\u2014. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be\u2014and the ability to direct\u2014interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. Dawn."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. I think, in terms of the levels of measures\u2014and I understand what you're saying\u2014but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector\u2014just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking\u201450 plus providers\u2014it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. So, the informal measures might not be as prevalent as they are currently, possibly."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close to the sector, close enough to be able to provide that soft regulation, those really important relationships in a way\u2014. So, it has to be created in such a way and resourced in such a way that it allows that to happen, and that's my intention."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. Well, then, of course, the University of Wales said to us that they felt that there was the potential for HEFCW to issue directions enforceable by injunction to remedy minor matters. So, I think, from what you're saying, you wouldn't be expecting that to happen. Just the fact that they've got the power doesn't necessarily mean that that's what they're going to do."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I think it's important to recognise when HEFCW can enforce its directions by way of an injunction. If they were to do that because a university was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code\u2014personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. I wouldn't describe that as a minor matter."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "No. That's fair enough. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution. But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Hefin David has some questions now on fee and access plans."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly\u2014what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, I think there's an opportunity there to look to restructure. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. Can we do them differently to make them more effective? Yes, I think we can."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement\u2014part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. I think it's still\u2014. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. There's a real problem there. So, what you're saying\u2014can I just pin down what you're saying\u2014is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "That's my preference.\u00a0So, I think the principle\u2014I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018\u2014with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular?"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative proposals. I meet on a regular basis with both HEFCW\u2014I meet separately with the vice-chancellors, and I've been very keen to develop a stronger working relationship with chairs, and perhaps we'll come on to issues of governance later. So, we are constantly discussing with stakeholders all options for change\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I suppose the message I'm getting as chair of the cross-party group on higher education is that there could still be more direct consultation with stakeholders. That's the message I've received. Now, I've got no evidence to say it has or hasn't happened, but that's the message I've received."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "If I could just chip in for a moment, the Minister's outlined that there is very extensive, ongoing communication both ways with the sector, but the challenge of preparing a Bill is the balancing act between gathering in information\u2014and there's been a general consultation process and a technical consultation process\u2014and wanting to make sure that the Bill that's laid next year hasn't been discussed with anybody else before it comes to be considered by the Senedd. So, the broad principles have been discussed, but specific details of what goes into a Bill or policy instructions that inform a Bill haven't been the subject of consultation\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Because that happens at Stage 1."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "Indeed, yes."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. Sorry, can I move on to the next item?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Oh, you're going on to the next section."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Yes, unless there's anything specific\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Yes, I just wanted to clarify, if we're moving to a longer term approach to this, how will the new body be able to establish that things are actually working, that the powers are working, if we're working on a five-year time frame?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "As we've heard, we can't really properly assess fee and access plans in the current arrangements, because it takes time for those cohorts of students to go through and activities to go through. Being able to move to a system where fee and access plans, for instance, could be over a three-year period I think allows universities to be more strategic in some of their investments and some of their activities around fee and access. In a single-year plan, it's almost knee-jerk, it's the need to demonstrate that you're doing something, and doing that within that period of time, rather than a more strategic view\u2014. Can I just say, I know it's not quite subject to this, but we're really moving forward in terms of access and broadening access into the HE sector. For me, student financial support is one aspect of it, but if we're really thinking about social mobility and attracting people into higher education that have never been part of higher education before, our early figures would suggest\u2014they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Sorry, Hefin\u2014carry on."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I'll move on to managing risk, if that's okay. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. Those were the words used by Universities Wales\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No, no, I'm not disagreeing. My view is: I believe that the Act has struck that proportionality. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions\u2014? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand\u2014they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "Can I just chip in? I think that the category 'private' covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. So, I think we need to be careful in focusing on the inherent quality of things. We've made charitable status a key reference point in the operation of things at the moment. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But they fall outwith\u2014if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. If there were concerns about the quality of that provision, that course could be deregulated."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Dawn."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance\u2014we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively\u2014and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change\u2014Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance. And I think it's really important that parties have come together to recognise the issues and to agree to take action, because I think if we'd have tried to impose something, we'd have more resistance. So, there is an independent review going on at the moment\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Is that the risk review process in\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "That's the Gillian Camm review. This is a review that, as I said, Universities Wales and HEFCW have agreed to do together. It's chaired by Gillian Camm, who is the chair of the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, and she is doing an independent review to advise on changes to governance. And I welcome that, I'm very supportive of that, and that's happening at the moment. As I said, I'm glad that there's been recognition from within the sector themselves that they need to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me\u2014and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU\u2014is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women\u201444 per cent; BME\u2014as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice in governance going forward, and these are things that we hope to have discussions on whilst we bring the legislation forward."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "But also, I guess\u2014sorry, Chair\u2014a greater understanding, that anybody going in to become a governor of one of these institutions has a greater understanding of what is expected of them. Do you think that that's a gap that needs to be plugged?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "One of the things that HEFCW have led on with AdvanceHE, the body that encompasses the leadership foundation, is a development programme for governing bodies, and that started earlier\u2014well, it's been going on for some time, but it was recommenced earlier this year, with a session for all of the chairs of universities in Wales. And I believe\u2014I'll need to check this\u2014that there are plans to engage with each of the governing bodies, because, as you rightly say, and this lies behind a lot of what we've been discussing, the activities of these institutions have become much more complex over recent years, and so there is a need for that training and development and understanding also of the fast-changing nature of that activity."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, just before we move on, can I ask whether it's your plan to legislate on that, as they've done in Scotland?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "As I said, I don't want to pre-empt scrutiny of the Bill, because we need to be able to come to the committee and do that in the entirety, rather than picking off individual bits of it, but we are absolutely exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition with regard to governance."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now from Si\u00e2n on quality assurance."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. We've heard evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provision in two further education colleges. That sounds to me\u00a0like some kind of an anomaly or an unintended consequence of the Act. Could you clarify that and explain the situation in that instance?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Thank you. My understanding\u2014and as I said, it's a bit difficult, because I can't put myself into the thought process of the Minister at the time and what his expectation was. But, certainly, my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, it was an expectation built into the Act that HEFCW and Estyn would work together on these matters. The Act built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act, which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions. So, as a consequence of that approach, HEFCW's quality assessment duty currently encompasses all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution. So, it is complicated, and Huw can help me out here if I get it wrong, but my understanding is that it was not an unintended consequence, that was the expectation of what would happen when the legislation was passed. Huw."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "I would completely agree with what the Minister has said."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "As always. [Laughter.] At least in public, Huw."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "There is the expectation that they will work together in concert. There's a lot of joint operation. I think, going forward, we would expect that to continue. We're looking to the new Bill to try to make that clearer. That was a theme in the general and technical consultation exercises that we've engaged in over the last couple of years."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "So, you're happy, therefore, that that partnership has worked. Are you happy with that?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Certainly, in our consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. No concerns about it, certainly from further education colleges."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. But, I'm not aware of any dissatisfaction."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. And by an extension of that, it would be compatible with current UK-wide baseline standards. So, we don't want to create specific problems for the HE sector in Wales."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us:"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?' And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. Huw."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "I agree, obviously. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. That's an issue not just in Wales. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And finally, therefore, looking at overseas providers. Currently, of course, universities can award their degrees to students being taught by providers overseas. We know this created problems for the University of Wales in 2011. They faced a scandal; that's probably the best word to use there. Will the new Bill address these issues?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. We've had conversations with both in the recent past. There is quality assurance of offshore activity through the QAA. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. I don't think we're currently looking to mandate the detail of how that should happen. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. I think we would look to that as a primary mechanism."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you both for attending this morning and answering all our questions? As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you both for your attendance this morning."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Item 3 then is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. Paper to note 2 is additional information from HEFCW, following the meeting on 18 July, in relation to our post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act. And paper to note 3 is a letter from us to the Welsh Local Government Association on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. This is the letter that we agreed we would send last week.

Please wait until I call on you by name before you begin to speak. When you are ready to speak, click on the microphone icon to activate your microphone, or hold the space bar down while you are speaking. If you release the bar, your microphone will revert to mute, just like a walkie-talkie. Honourable members, I would like to remind you that if you want to speak English, you should be on the English channel. If you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Please direct your remarks through the chair. Should you need to request the floor outside of your designated speaking time, you should activate your mike and state that you have a point of order. If a member of the committee wishes to intervene on a point of order raised by another person, you should use the raised hand function to indicate to the chair that you wish to speak. To do this, click on the participant button at the bottom of your screen. When the list appears, you will see the raised hand option beside your name. Speak slowly and clearly at all times. When you are not speaking, leave your microphone on mute. It is highly recommended that you use a headset with a microphone. You have to remember to switch languages. Should any technical challenges arise, for example, in relation to interpretation, please advise the chair immediately by raising a point of order, and the technical team will work on resolving them. Please note that we may need to suspend during these times in order to correct a problem. I want to remind the honourable members to mute their microphones when they are not speaking.

It also included a five-year review. Petitioners on the first petition I'm presenting are very concerned to see Bill C-7 before Parliament, which removes safeguards ahead of that five-year review. Petitioners specifically mention their concerns about the removal of the mandatory 10-day reflection period, which can already be waived in certain circumstances. They are concerned about reducing the number of witnesses required to oversee it and ensure that a request has been properly made. I commend that petition to the consideration of the House. The second and final petition that I will be presenting today is with respect to Senate Bill S-204. This would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ from a person who did not consent. This responds specifically to concerns about organ harvesting in the People's Republic of China involving Falun Gong practitioners and increasing concerns that this is being or about to be applied to Uighurs as well. Canada can and should take action on this. Petitioners are noting that in the previous Parliament there were bills on this, Bill C-350 and Bill S-240. Now, in this Parliament there is a bill, Bill S-204, and the petitioners hope that this 43rd Parliament will be the one that gets it passed."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We will go to Ms. May."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP)", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's an honour. This is my first occasion to present a petition in our virtual format of the COVID-19 committee. Thank you to you and your staff, Mr. Chair, for developing a system that allows us to present petitions electronically. The petition I am presenting today, which was previously approved, is from a number of constituents who are concerned that we pursue the Paris Agreement to hold the global average temperature increase to no more than 1.5C.

You said it could be no more than five minutes but that I had up to five minutes. Thirty-four seconds leaves a lot of time to have a quick question and a quick response.

Instead of responding to specific COVID-19 challenges, our farmers are facing the Liberals' reannounced $125 million that was already budgeted in the AgriRecovery program.

Justin Trudeau", "content": "Mr. Chair, I would suggest respectfully that the honourable member take a look once again at the announcement we made, which actually highlights significant new investments to support our agricultural industry. I certainly agree that there is more to do. Every step of the way in this unprecedented situation, we've been moving forward on doing more, on adjusting and on investing more.

It is an enormous hit to their bottom line, and the recent carbon tax hike is taking even more money out of the pockets of farmers at a time when they can afford it the least.

This is the way of creating a better future for our kids and grandkids, which I know people in communities right across the country, including our farm communities, want to see happen. We are moving forward in a responsible way to put a price on pollution and put more money in average Canadians' pockets."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We now continue with Mrs.Gill.

I am thinking about the lobster fishery in the Magdalen Islands, the crab fishery on the Cte-Nord or those fishing for herring in the south of the Gasp. Because imports have ceased, because the domestic market is weak and in decline because of the interruption of the tourism and restaurant industries, the fishing industry and its fishers must be supported.

Justin Trudeau", "content": "Our fishers do exceptional work that is extremely important in feeding Canadians and in contributing to our economic success through their exports around the world.

We know that these are difficult and unprecedented times, and we are going to"}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Marilne Gill", "content": "My thanks to the Prime Minister. I am actually talking about help for the fishers. I know about the processing industry and the $62.5million to be used essentially for freezing products, but I am talking about the fishers themselves. Given the economic situation, most of our fishers are getting ready to leave. First, there are health risks. We know very well that it is impossible for them to observe all the social distancing measures. They have to incur additional expenses in order to conduct their normal fishing activities. In addition, they feel that they will be losing money, because of the drop in the price of their resource. They are just as essential as farmers, but they are going to have to work at a loss and they are not going to have workers to assist them. Workers in the seasonal industry do not know what tomorrow will bring. They do not even know whether they will be able to put food on the table next year. Are you going to do anything else, in addition to the assistance of $62.5million? Time is of the essence. Our fishers have lacked certainty for weeks and they are very concerned."}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Yes, indeed, we are going to do other things. Other investments will be made in various sectors in order to support Canadians. We recognize the challenges that fishers must face in terms of social distancing and of work that is often seasonal. We are going to continue working with the industry, with the fishers, and with the coastal communities in order to ensure that people have confidence in their abilities and in their future. In times of crisis, it is important for the government to be there to support people, and that is exactly what we are going to continue to do. This is an unprecedented crisis, but we can see once more that Canadians are there for each other. Our government will continue to be there for the fishers and the fishing industry."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Marilne Gill", "content": "I would have preferred us to be there from the start. Clearly, this is a difficult crisis. But, given the cyclical nature of the industry, some sectors have had to postpone for several weeks the preparations they need for fishing activities. The current program could be modified in a number of ways, to accommodate the cycle, the dates, and the size of the companies. They would really like to take advantage of the $40,000loan, but they cannot because of their payroll. Given the dates, they are also ineligible for the 75%salary subsidy. I can already suggest a number of solutions to the government and to the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, that would bring help to those businesses very quickly. The fishers carry on, because it is a duty for them, because they want to help us and to be part of the effort at this time of crisis. At the same time, they have no guarantee that they will be supported. I would really like to hear a guarantee that they will be supported, that they will be able to put food on the table this year, and that they will be able to support the communities that often depend on the fishing industry, a major industry in those communities."}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Minister Jordan has been working with the fishers, the fishing industry and the communities affected by the crisis since the crisis began. We are assessing a number of solutions. We have proposed various solutions to support the communities, the workers and the families. This is an unprecedented situation. From the outset, our priority has been to support the millions of Canadians from coast to coast who have lost their jobs. We have been able to do so, but we are going to continue to work for those who must now face difficulties. We are going to be there for each other. That is what people are expecting from our government and from other Canadians."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Before we move to the next question, I would like to remind members of the committee to speak slowly, and to address their remarks to the chair and not directly to each other.

They've seen revenues plummet, and at the same time the cost of delivering municipal services has risen. As the Prime Minister knows, municipalities are unable to run deficits and so they are facing the reality of cutbacks and serious cuts to the services that Canadians depend on. We know that municipalities are vital during this time to provide services to Canadians. They're going to be even more important during the recovery, especially when it comes to delivering on the infrastructure programs before us. The Federation of Canadian Municipalities and mayors across Canada have called for emergency financial relief for the municipal sector. My question for the Prime Minister is, when can they expect federal financial support to arrive?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Mr. Chair, no government in Canada's history has done more to work with our municipalities, with our cities, with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to respond to the challenges they're facing and to partner with them. Things from infrastructure to investments have made a huge difference right across the country in the quality of life of Canadians in towns, large and small, from coast to coast to coast. As I'm sure the member well knows, our Constitution requires that most of the funding for municipalities flow through the provinces. We are working with the provinces, as we continue to work with the cities, to ensure that we're able to support this order of government that delivers the vast majority of services to Canadians with very little financial means.

Transit systems have been hit particularly hard and have seen the bulk of the layoffs in the municipal sector. These transit services carry essential workers to work, whether they are health care workers, grocery store workers, janitors or others. The risk is that we will see higher fares to deal with this financial crisis. We will see service cutbacks precisely at a time when we want to be expanding transit and improving transit in our communities.

Could the Prime Minister explain how that is fair?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Mr. Chair, I'm happy to explain to the member and to all Canadians that our Constitution creates federal areas of jurisdiction and provincial areas of jurisdiction. The airline industry, like banking, like telecommunications, is a federal area of jurisdiction that we have been able to move forward on.

In particular, it is to protect the three remaining fluent speakers of the Nuxalk language, these cherished elders in their community. The Haida on Haida Gwaii have set up a similar checkpoint, as have communities throughout British Columbia, yet federal support for indigenous communities amounts to only $39 million for all of the indigenous communities in B.C.

It is important in a time of pandemic, Mr. Chair, that we not play politics and that humanity comes together. I can say, after my COVID foreign ministers call, that the world community has come together to make sure that supply chains will remain intact and that we will have transit hubs and air bridges.

You know as well as I do that for 90%of Canadians, the misuse of their personal data is a cause for concern, whether it be for profiling or business development purposes.

Minister, in my riding of Etobicoke Centre, we are mourning the loss of 40 residents to COVID-19 at the Eatonville long-term care centre. Over 143 residents and 88 staff members have now tested positive for the virus. This tragedy is not only taking place in Etobicoke Centre but across Canada. Of all Canadians who have died from COVID-19, 79% were living in long-term care homes. That's over 2,000 seniors. This is a catastrophe, and it's frankly unacceptable. Our seniors and their families deserve better. I understand that long-term care homes fall within the jurisdiction of provincial governments in Canada, but this is a crisis. What is the federal government doing right now to help protect our seniors who are living in long-term care homes from COVID-19? What will we do to reform our long-term care homes in the future to ensure that our seniors in Etobicoke Centre and across Canada get the care they deserve?"}, {"speaker": "Hon.

We are deeply concerned by the outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities, and our thoughts are with those who have lost a loved one. It's a very difficult time. As my colleague mentioned, while these facilities are regulated by provinces and territories, we have been focused on protecting the health and safety of long-term care residents and staff while working with our partners in a team Canada approach. We've released guidelines to prevent and control COVID-19 infections. We're working with the provinces and territories to cost-share a temporary salary top-up for long-term care workers. We are working through investing $2 billion to secure personal protective equipment for the health of workers, including those in the long-term care homes, and we've deployed the Canadian Armed Forces to assist 25 long-term care homes in Quebec and Ontario.

My question is on the support offered to the agri-food sector announced on Tuesday. It is very welcome support, but I sincerely believe the farm sector will be taking the Prime Minister up on the suggestion that $250 million should be seen as an initial investment. Potatoes are the number one commodity in Prince Edward Island. However, as a result of reduced processor contracts for next year, plus cancelled seed contracts, millions of dollars of seed and process potatoes have no home. To make matters worse, farmers have high fixed costs that they now have to spread over fewer acres. How does the minister see Tuesday's announcement addressing potato farmers' concerns? Second, in 2013, long-term financial safety nets were gutted by the Harper government. Will the minister be coming forward with improved business risk management programs as a result?"}, {"speaker": "Hon.

It's a beautiful rural riding with lots of agricultural production. I want to recognize the hard work of farmers throughout the crisis. On Tuesday, I was proud to announce one more step for supporting our producers and processors. We know the importance of our potato farmers, and that's why we are launching a first-ever surplus food purchase program, a $50-million fund designed to help redistribute existing inventories, such as potatoes, to local food organizations. On the financial safety net that we have in place for our farmers, called the business risk management program, we announced up to $125 million in funding through AgriRecovery and made changes to AgriStability that will help producers quickly. I will continue to discuss with my provincial counterparts toenhance and improve the BRM programs.

With no business income and without emergency financing, it is virtually impossible for her to pay her bills or come up with the 25% needed for the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance program. The government promised to be flexible and willing to adjust its COVID response rollout so that nobody falls through the cracks, but Robyn, like tens of thousands of proprietors who are the economic job creators of our communities, urgently needs the government's help now.

Now with the new rollout of the rent support, they're not sure if their landlord is willing to play ball and even apply. That's three separate programs that leave them out. Heather was in tears last night as she told me that they have done nothing wrong to deserve being excluded from these emergency programs. I agree.

That's over 286,000 Manitobans. I've been speaking with many small business owners in my riding. It's been heartbreaking, frankly, to hear that everything they've built and sacrificed for is in serious jeopardy, and through no fault of their own. Your government has created programs that are supposed to help them, but many legitimate businesses aren't able to apply. That could mean bankruptcy and cost thousands of Manitobans jobs. This is wrong. I'm hoping to hear specifics, not just nice words, on what you're going to do to help them. There are three issues regarding access to the $40,000 CEBA loan. First, businesses that recently incorporatedfor example, in late 2019are unable to apply their entire 2019 payroll. As a result, many are falling short of the $20,000 payroll threshold required to qualify for this loan. Second, many businesses contract their employees rather than have them on payroll. They also are unable to qualify for this loan. Third, many businesses use personal rather than business banking accounts. They aren't able to qualify for this loan either. What is your government going to do about these three scenarios?"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "I just want to remind honourable members to place their questions through the Chair and not directly to the minister. As well, please take into consideration the interpreters, who have to listen and translate, so that we can have this conversation."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Mary Ng", "content": "Mr. Chair, I want to thank the honourable member for that question. Right from the very beginning, we've always said that we will listen and that we will work to make sure that measures go out to help our Canadian small businesses. She's absolutely right: 98% of all our businesses in this country are small businesses, so they absolutely contribute enormously to our communities and are job creators. That is why we have put out significant measures. For the Canada emergency business account, over 550,000 small businesses have been approved and are getting that support. I absolutely acknowledge that there is more work to do. I can assure the honourable member that we will continue to do this work so that businesses, all businesses, are supported, whether it is helping keep your employees together, helping with rent support, helping to keep your business's expenses low, or of course helping with the capital that is needed so that you can pay your operating expenses and your bills through this difficult time."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Raquel Dancho", "content": "Mr. Chair, I didn't hear any answers from the minister's remarks, unfortunately. Moving on, there are two issues regarding the 50% commercial rent assistance subsidy, where landlords pay 25%, the government pays 50%, and the tenant is responsible for 25%. First, many of the small landlords aren't able to take a 25% hit to their income, and are unable to provide the subsidy to their tenants. Second, with the 70% decline in revenue threshold for small businesses to even be eligible for the rent assist, many restaurants are at 65% or 67% decline. They desperately need this subsidy but aren't able to qualify. This is not about problems with the program details. What is the government planning to do to streamline this program for small businesses that can't access but desperately need the rent subsidy?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Mlanie Joly", "content": "Mr. Chair, as the Minister of Official Languages, I just want to raise the fact that interpretation is very complicated right now.

They are working very hard and trying to keep up."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "That's a reasonable request.

Perhaps we could get back to my question about the rent subsidy."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We stopped the time. You're not losing any time on this one."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Raquel Dancho", "content": "Okay. I will try to speak more slowly."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "I appreciate it. Thank you. The interpreters appreciate it. Now we'll go to the minister, please."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Mona Fortier", "content": "As you know, we've been working with the provinces and territories to provide this forgivable loan to commercial property owners, who in turn lower the rent of their tenants by 75%.

It will be very important that we understand what happens across the country, and we will monitor and adapt the program as we"}, {"speaker": "Ms. Raquel Dancho", "content": "Mr. Chair, it has been in the media quite a bit that this rent subsidy is not helping many, many, many small business owners. It's falling short of everything that was announced, so I think it needs to be taken a bit more seriously than that. There are two issues regarding the 75% wage subsidy. First, employers who pay themselves and their employees dividends rather than wages are unable to qualify. Second, there is also a 30% threshold revenue decline needed in order to apply. Many of the businesses in my riding are at 27% or 29%. They desperately need these funds but are unable to qualify. What is the government planning to do for these small businesses?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Mona Fortier", "content": "Again, thank you to the hon. member for sharing the realities she's hearing from small business owners. We are providing help and support for businesses through these very difficult times. The wage subsidy has been taken up and is working for many businesses.

We need to get the information to Canadians on COVID-19, which is why we have started an ad-buy campaign of $30 million, which is being distributed in more than 900 local, regional and national newspapers across the country and 500 radio and TV stations in 12 different languages, including Farsi, Mandarin, Spanish, Italian and many more."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Kevin Waugh", "content": "Mr. Minister, I talked to the Winnipeg Free Press yesterday. It has received two ads from an ad agency in connection with the $30 million the government is doling out to help media outlets. They had one ad on March 27. The second ad was on April 11. That is two ads in the Winnipeg Free Press in the last eight weeks. Is this the kind of money you're attempting to dole out to help media: two ads in eight weeks?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Steven Guilbeault", "content": "Madam Chair, we have been doing a number of things for our media in Canada over the last few months and will continue to do so. On top of that $30 million ad-buy campaign, we have been investing $50 million in local journalism. Just this year, it means that 200 journalists will be hired in areas across the country where journalism is more poorly defined.

This is what he had to say about his economic recovery plan:     We are going to remain focused on the economy as a wholeinnovationresearch and science, the green economy and a fairer economyThere are things we are all reflecting on right now that reflection is going to continue.   That was a weak answer. It didn't inspire much confidence. Can the government assure Canadians that it is being proactive and working on a plan to get the economy moving again? It must act now. Things are starting to reopen gradually. Is the government going to take concrete action to revive the economy?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Chrystia Freeland", "content": "Yes, absolutely. Our government is wholly committed to restarting the economy, and we are working closely with the provinces to do just that.

The discussion between the Prime Minister and the premiers is continuing today."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Jol Godin", "content": "MadamChair, before we go any further, since it took a while for the minister, or the government, to answer the question, can I have that time back to ask questions?"}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends)", "content": "I stopped the clock, Mr.Godin."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Jol Godin", "content": "Thank you. The Prime Minister's answer during his appearance on Tout le monde en parle didn't inspire much confidence and doesn't line up with the Deputy Prime Minister's comments. How can the government be proud of announcing $252million in assistance for the agri-food sector, when that is less than 1% of all the program funding the government has committed to help Canadians get through the COVID-19 crisis? Clearly, the government doesn't see the food supply chain as a priority and has no regard for farmers and pork and beef producers. Does the government realize that eating is vital to Canadians? When is the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food going to adjust the program and show respect for Canadian farmers?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau", "content": "I have the utmost respect for farmers. We are going step by step. We've already confirmed various supports for the agricultural sector. This week, we focused on beef and pork producers and processors, as well as sectors with product surpluses that can be redirected to food banks.

Bear in mind that a number of programs are already available to farmers."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Jol Godin", "content": "I'd like to switch topics now. PortneufJacques-Cartier is home to a company that is already licensed by Health Canada and that, for 20years, has been manufacturing medical equipment including masks, face shields and thermometers. This is equipment our health workers need. The company has a licence from the federal government. In mid-March, Health Canada reached out to the company to find out how much equipment it could manufacture to help fight COVID-19. The company confirmed that it could immediately start producing 200,000masks a week, ramping up to a million masks over the next few weeks. Forty-five days later, it is still waiting on its first order from the Canadian government. We are managing a crisis with a limited supply of medical equipment.

Deb Schulte", "content": "Madam Chair, I want to assure the member that we are quite aware that this pandemic has typically affected single seniors, and many of those, given that they live longer, are single senior women.

That is on average almost $400 for single seniors. There's more work to do. We know that, so stay tuned."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Jenica Atwin", "content": "Madam Chair, older women represent a high proportion of residents in long-term care facilities. Having spent their lives caring for parents, children and often their partners, they find themselves needing care in nursing homes. Multiple outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care homes in Canada have highlighted systemic gaps that senior and elderly women may face in such facilities, as well as the working conditions of the female-dominated ranks of nurses and personal support workers. Madam Chair, can the minister commit to implementing a federal strategy for long-term care homes that recognizes quality of life for residents and working conditions for the employees, ideally one that goes hand in hand with a poverty reduction plan and enhanced home and community care investments across the country?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Deb Schulte", "content": "Madam Chair, I do want to thank the hon. member for her question. It's an important one. We are obviously deeply saddened by the outbreaks that have been going on in long-term care facilities and those who have lost their lives. We do recognize that the administration of long-term care and palliative care is the responsibility of provinces and territories; however, we have been taking a team Canada approach, and as you already know, we've been doing tremendous work with them to try to ensure that those who live in those facilities can be well cared for and safe.

Patty Hajdu", "content": "Madam Chair, thank you very much to the member for the question. I'm so glad that she's raising the issue of mental health and in particular how poor mental health is oftentimes connected to our socio-economic status. I appreciate the nuance in that question. She's right. We do have new resources that are available to all Canadians free of charge through the Wellness Together portal, but there is more to do. I think the announcement of top-up wages, for example, which the Prime Minister spoke about today, is another example of how we're taking the health and wellness of all low-income Canadians very seriously.

Anyone who abuses the program could face fines of up to 225% of the subsidy amount as well as five years in prison."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Alistair MacGregor", "content": "Madam Chair, I didn't really hear a yes to that question, so I'll repeat it.

Diane Lebouthillier", "content": "We will keep going after companies that engage in tax evasion. I want to be clear. We will target those who are responsible, not innocent workers. An employee is an employee, regardless of who they work for. The wage subsidy program does not hand a blank cheque over to employers.

Mr.Perron, you may go ahead."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Yves Perron (BerthierMaskinong, BQ)", "content": "Thank you, Mr.Chair. My question will come as no surprise, since it has to do with agriculture. I hear the questions my fellow members are asking, and to be frank, I don't find the answers satisfactory. It is well and good to talk about existing programs, but they aren't working, so enough with that refrain. That's what people are telling us. It's not just members of the opposition saying it. This morning, both farmers and processors came together for a press conference at the Union des producteurs agricoles's head office in Longueuil. Six stakeholders from different sectors sounded the alarm. Can the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food therefore tell us when she will announce significant supports for the industry?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau", "content": "We have already announced significant amounts of support, and more is on the way. I'd like to correct my fellow member. It's not that the programs aren't working; it's that they aren't generous enough in farmers' eyes. That's why I'm working with my provincial counterparts to make improvements to programming, including AgriStability. Here's an example. After using the online AgriStability benefit estimator, a pork producer found out that he would get $11 per head, as they say in the industry. Pork producers are calling for $20 per head, so it's a good start, even though it's not enough and it isn't what they are asking for. We want to keep working together, but farmers have to access the money available to them through AgriStability."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Yves Perron", "content": "Now it's my turn to correct the minister. Even before the crisis, we were hearing from people in the industry that the programs were neither suitable nor sufficient. We are in a crisis, and this is an exceptional situation. In the case of mad cow disease, farmers received direct assistance. That's the kind of assistance we are calling for. We don't want to hear about growing levels of debt. Of course, this is a first step, but farms are already deep in debt. A few days ago, the government announced $50million in funding for pork producers, even though they are asking for $20per hog for 27million hogs. The government's support covers just 2.5million hogs. When I call the measure insufficient, I mean it is grossly insufficient. It's high time the government put forth more support. It has to stop saying that it's working hard and examining the situation. The government has to listen to the people in the industry. Again, this morning, they had some interesting proposals. When is the government going to announce a whole lot more in funding support? What's been announced so far is only 10% of what farmers are asking for."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau", "content": "We are going step by step. The programs are already in place. We are trying to make them better, and we are committed to doing that. These programs are cost-shared with the provinces. However, I would point out to the member that, when it comes to AgriRecovery, we made an exception to the rule. We are moving forward in every province to help pork and beef producers. That's two funding envelopes of $50million each to help cover the additional costs from the decrease in plant processing capacity. That's new money that was not yet available, money we introduced this week. As the Prime Minister said, we are going to do more, and we are moving forward step by step."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Yves Perron", "content": "What we concluded in committee this week is that the $125million is not new money. It was already earmarked for the programs. The government can't say that programs already exist and, at the same time, claim that they are new programs. Something doesn't add up there. What's more, there are different ways to make money available. I'd like to talk compensation. Everyone knows that the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement came into force a month earlier than planned, despite the promises that had been made. That resulted in additional losses, once again. An easy way to make money available without committing new spending is to provide compensation and announce programs for supply-managed sectors that got nothing. It seems to me that a time of crisis is a time for the government to practise some judo and announce measures. I am reaching out to the government, as I always do, but it has to come forward with announcements. Can we expect the government to announce measures in the coming days?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau", "content": "Our commitment to farmers in supply-managed sectorsmeaning, egg, poultry and dairy farmersis as strong as it always was. I repeat, our commitment is clear. Dairy producers received their first payment at the end of last year or the beginning of this year. Support for poultry and egg farmers is in the form of investment programs, which aligns well with the recovery. At this time, we are focusing on emergency programs to help farmers hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. When it comes to the dairy sector, I hope I can count on your support. As you know, legislative changes are needed to grant the Canadian Dairy Commission's request and increase its borrowing limit by $200million so it can buy more butter and cheese."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Our next question will go to Mr. Lake."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Mike Lake (EdmontonWetaskiwin, CPC)", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, we're all inundated, as we've heard during this entire question period, with Canadians' concerns about the economic restrictions and the social restrictions that they're under. Over the last couple of months, the WHO has given one very consistent message in terms of coming out of those economic and social restrictions. On March 16, Dr. Tedros said in his briefing, We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test. On March 25, 44 days ago, he said, Aggressive measures to find, isolate, test, treat and trace are not only the best and fastest way out of extreme social and economic restrictionstheyre also the best way to prevent them. Does the minister agree with the WHO that relentless testing and tracing are critical to a successful economic and social relaunch strategy in Canada?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "Thanks to the member for the very astute observation and question. Absolutely, we agree that testing and contact tracing will form an important part of our response to living with COVID. We've been investing heavily in ensuring that we have the lab capacity, the collaboration across provinces and territories, and the variety of testing options to help us increase our capacity to test. We are aiming right now for a high volume of tests, but I will also say that in Canada we have one of the highest testing rates in the world. Although we're doing well, I can assure him that I am with him and I believe we need to do more."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Mike Lake", "content": "I have some really quick questions for follow-up. First, what is Canada's current testing capability?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "Mr. Chair, as I mentioned to his colleagues yesterday, we have currently the capacity to do approximately 60,000 tests per day across the country."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Mike Lake", "content": "How many tests were conducted each day on average in Canada last week?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "Mr. Chair, it's hard for me to get that exact number, but I will get back to him with the exact number."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Mike Lake", "content": "I'll save you the time. The exact number was 28,851, on average, every day last week. That's a gap of 30,000 from what your stated testing capability is. I'll give another quote from Dr. Tam, back on April 22, 15 days ago. She said, As a first tranche, roughly close to 60,000 is where the provinces can potentially expand to as a target already. Does the minister happen to know, ballpark, what the average number of daily tests in Canada has been since that statement?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "Your estimate was slightly higher than what my estimate was going to be, so that's a great piece of news. Listen, I will just say that I think if the premise here is that we could be doing more testing. I would agree, but I will also say that the provinces and territories are working incredibly hard on testing strategies that meet their own specific needs. I'm happy to have a conversation with the member later about that testing strategy. Dr. Tam works with all the chief public health officers across the country to ensure that their testing strategy is going to be applicable and appropriate for their particular jurisdictions. We, as the federal government, provide the capacity for them to conduct those tests."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Mike Lake", "content": "Following up on that, is there a jurisdiction in Canada where relentless testing is not the appropriate strategy as provinces consider relaunching?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "Each province and territory has its own outbreak and its own epidemic.

The plants closed, and thousands of workers were unemployed. Meanwhile, both the art industry and fishery industry had received support from the government.

However, not so many people were willing to accept the rent reduction, indicating that the policy might not be very effective. Another problem related to social safety was the handgun smuggling.

The residents of SaanichGulf Islands are calling on the government to simplify the process for protection of marine protected areas. It's a multi-layered communication process. The marine protected area first proposed in the 1970s for the southern Strait of Georgia, now called the Salish Sea, has been awaiting designation for so long that it was originally endorsed by Jacques Cousteau. That gives us a sense for why petitioners are calling for a simplified and more rapid process. The second petition is from petitioners who are very concerned about our obligations under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and our commitments under the Truth and Reconciliation Commission calls to action. They specifically reference the RCMP violation of UNDRIP in its actions on Wet'suwet'en territory and ask the government to commit to actually living the principles embodied in UNDRIP."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We will now go to Mr. Hardie."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Ken Hardie (FleetwoodPort Kells, Lib.)", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chair.

Over the past 20years or so, culture, especially music, has never been as accessible as it is now. Paradoxically, creators' incomes have never been so low. The advent of digital technology has completely overturned the system for distributing the wealth generated by creators for the benefit of various Web stakeholders, many of whom are billionaires. This petition addresses these problems and proposes realistic solutions. The first is to set a minimum royalty model for streaming platforms for artists. The second is to update the existing private copying system. The third is for Internet and cell phone providers who sell their services as direct access to culture to share their profits with artists. The fourth is that the GAFAMs have to pay taxes on their services. Six thousand people have already signed the first version of this petition, launched last month by musician JordanOfficer and supported by singer BarbaraSecours.

I have four petitions to present today. I will be as brief as you suggested, although I will observe that if some members are going on longer during petitions than they normally do, it might be because the government has taken away so many of the tools that opposition members normally have for raising important issues in the House. The first petition deals with the issue of euthanasia and long-term care. The petitioners are concerned that instead of focusing on improving medically assisted life, something that we know is a major issue in light of recent revelations, the government has put so much time and legislative energy into efforts to continually further expand euthanasia in Canada and remove vital safeguards. The second petition speaks to the ongoing conversations happening in Canada around systemic discrimination and systemic racism. I think we do need to reflect on systemic discrimination. This petition deals specifically with Bill 21 in Quebec and raises concerns. The reality of the way that bill applies is that people from certain backgrounds who wish to practise their faith are not able to fully participate in Canadian society if they are employed in the public service. This petition asks the government to provide a response on that issue, something it hasn't done in response to past petitions on this. The third petition deals with the issue of firearms. The petitioners want to see the government take a strong response in dealing with illegal guns and gun smuggling. The petition notes that the vast majority of firearms-related crimes in Canada involves illegal guns. At the same time, the petitioners are concerned that the government has the wrong focusthat is, harassing law-abiding firearms ownerswithout putting in place substantial measures to deal with illegal guns. The petitioners want to see the reversal of the order in council from May 1 and strong measures to deal with illegal firearms. The fourth and final petition deals with Bill S-204, a bill that would make it a criminal offence for a Canadian to go abroad and receive an organ from a person who has not consented to giving that organ. It would also create a mechanism by which someone could be deemed inadmissible to Canada if they were involved in organ harvesting and trafficking. The petitioners are supportive of Bill S-204 and of similar bills in previous parliaments and would like to see us pass that bill as soon as possible."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Presenting petitions, Mr. Lamoureux."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Kevin Lamoureux (Winnipeg North, Lib.)", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chair.

My mother is a home care worker and my sister is a nurse. Even before the crisis, they would often share the hardships they faced on a day-to-day basis. It's a tough job at the best of times. In a pandemic, these jobs are life-threatening. I think we can all agree that these workers deserve more than our good wishes. They deserve a raise. That is why we have worked with the provinces to implement pandemic pay. In British Columbia more than 250,000 front-line workers are eligible for this program. That works out to a pay increase of about $4 an hour. It's a small show of our appreciation for their difficult and priceless contribution to our country. Share this message and say thanks to our front-line workers, participate in the 7 p.m. cheer, and order a pizza for your local nurses.

Among the countless ordinary Canadians who have stepped up to do extraordinary work during COVID-19, I wish to draw attention to our teachers. Teachers have always had a special place in my heart. My father was a teacher, and my daughter-in-law, Kelly Webb, is one now. I'm certain that my colleagues can all easily remember a teacher in their past who played an important role in helping them achieve their potential. I remember my grade 12 English teacher, Vince Weaver, at Westminster Secondary School in London. He made me realize that I could do so much more than I believed. Across the country, as schools closed, teachers did not stop their work. Some took their classes online. Others found innovative ways to continue engaging with their students. This is not the school year anyone imagined, and what the next one will look like is unclear, but our teachers in London West and across Canada have shown that no matter what, they will be there to help our next generation shine."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Before proceeding to the next presenter, I just want to remind the honourable members in the chamber that I realize that the six-foot limit makes it harder to whisper to each other, but we're hearing a bit of rumble, so I just want you to try to whisper at your best.

The theme Proud of our traditions will be the focus of this celebration for the people of Montarville. This is a good illustration of the rich history of this municipality nestled in the western foothills of Mont-Saint-Bruno. The seigneury of Montarville was granted in1710 to the illustrious former governor of Trois-Rivires, PierreBoucher. The parish of Saint-Bruno, which took root there and in which a village grew, became a municipal corporation in1845. To this day, it is one of the most prosperous localities, with a strong sense of belonging, a very dynamic community life and jealously preserved natural environments. A whole program had been drawn up for the celebration, but the current health crisis has taken over some of the planned activities, which has in no way diminished the pride and festive spirit of the people of Montarville.

I'm pleased with the number of nominations I received that honour everyone from front-line workers to businesses that are innovating in these difficult times to volunteers who are finding new ways to reach out.

The peaceful protests that we're seeing across the country and around the world were not triggered by an isolated incident. They are fuelled by decades of ineffective action against something that is so insidious and deeply entrenched in our history, systems and institutions. For us, that is the racial inequality faced by Canada's indigenous and black communities. Anti-black racism is real. It exists right here in Canada, in our communities, including in Brampton. It exists when racialized students at McCrimmon Middle School are called McCriminals. It exists when a shocking report exposes the Peel District School Board's failure to work fairly with the black community. It exists when D'Andre Campbell, who was fighting mental illness, loses his life at the hands of the police. It is clear that we need reform.

Each time, the conclusions have been overwhelming and highlight a disturbing reality.       The justice system has failed indigenous people. Are you going to respond, as you too often do, by moving on to the next one, or are you going to do what we expect you to do, which is to recognize that the justice system discriminates against indigenous people and that we have no less right to security than the rest of the population? In three months, police interventions have claimed more victims among our members than the pandemic. But it is not enough to simply take a knee and denounce racism. It's about standing up and taking action.

By refusing to hold regular parliamentary sittings, Mr. Trudeau is sending a strong message to the Canadian public that he alone is the one who matters. In 2014, he professed that Canadians want their Members of Parliament to be effective voices for their communities in Ottawa, and not merely mouthpieces for an all-too-powerful Prime Minister. As it stands, however, he has shut down Parliament. Effectively, he has stripped us, the opposition, of our privileges and our powers. Sadly, Mr. Trudeau has become the all-too-powerful Prime Minister that he once warned against. A government that does not allow for effective opposition is not functioning in the best interest of Canadians; it is operating in the best interest of itself and, even more so, the interest of the Prime Minister. Canadians deserve to flourish in a democracy, not merely survive under the autocracy that this Prime Minister has created."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We'll now go on to Ms. Zahid."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Salma Zahid (Scarborough Centre, Lib.)", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chair.

Under more pressure than ever, their staff and volunteers continue to serve a community whose need was great even before the crisis. Their food bank helps over 4,000 people weekly. They have opened outdoor washrooms and hand-washing stations for vulnerable communities and are delivering groceries and other essentials to vulnerable seniors. ACSA is a bridge between those who can help and those who need help, and they are just one example of how our community has come together to meet this challenge. There are restaurants and businesses donating meals to front-line workers, residents answering the call to stock the food bank shelves and neighbours looking in on the vulnerable and isolated.

Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition)", "content": "Mr. Chair, for months Conservatives have been pointing out flaws in Liberal government programs that are preventing Canadians from getting the help they need. The Prime Minister has refused to make these very technical changes to get more help to Canadians who need it. For example, on the wage subsidy, more than two-thirds of the money allocated for that program has lapsed because businesses don't qualify. I have a simple question. Will the Prime Minister change the program to allow companies who have made acquisitions to access the wage subsidy to keep more people working?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Papineau, Lib.)", "content": "Mr. Chair, from the very beginning we knew that as we rolled out measures, we would need to improve them and tweak them, and that's exactly what we've been doing over the past three months. We needed to make measures happen quickly for Canadians, and we did that. But we continued to improve them, to make additions and amendments so that more people could get the help they needed, including with the proposed legislation last week that expanded the reach of the wage subsidy to more businesses. Unfortunately, the Conservatives didn't even want us to debate that particular piece of legislation."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Andrew Scheer", "content": "Actually, Mr. Chair, it was the Liberals who said no to the motion to allow this Parliament to sit to debate that motion, and even in that legislation they refused to allow businesses who have made acquisitions to access the program. Now, when we look at the rent relief program, it is so difficult to apply for it that many landlords are refusing to bother, leaving even more small businesses to fall through the cracks. In fact, of the $3 billion allocated to the rent relief program, only $39 million has been paid out. That's less than 2%. Now, the Prime Minister is still using talking points from April. It's now June and he has refused to fix these programs and has successfully talked out the calendar on the days that the House of Commons could meet to discuss these programs. When will he make these changes to get more help to Canadians who need it?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Mr. Chair, throughout this pandemic, we have constantly been updating and expanding our various programs. We recognize, in conversations with the premiers, how important it is to make sure that we're working together, the provinces and the federal government, on issues like rent subsidies where commercial rent is indeed a provincial jurisdiction. Many provinces have moved forward with the eviction bans that are necessary to go along with this, and we'll continue to work with provinces to make sure that we're getting Canadians the help they need."}, {"speaker": "Hon.

He's abandoned Israel and committed funding to UNRWA, an organization whose schools have been used as storage facilities for Hamas rockets against Israeli civilians, and whose facilities have served as breeding grounds for racism and anti-Semitism. He has apologized for the Iranian regime when it shot down a plane full of Canadian citizens, and he refuses to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist entity.

When I was Speaker I always appreciated her help and advice about how to improve decorum in here.

Mr.Blanchet, you have the floor."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet", "content": "Mr.Chair, while the Greens and the Conservatives are saying that they'll be waiting outside after the meeting, I will ask a question. The Prime Minister has extended the Canada emergency response benefit, and that's good news, but it's not enough. Last week in the House, the government said it was urgent to fight fraud. For us, it was also urgent to adjust the CERB to the needs of the tourism, arts and agriculture sectors. Farmers are going to be seriously under-resourced. So what happened to the urgency of reforming the CERB? Why is the government refusing to talk to the opposition parties?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon.

It should have let us debate these concerns in the House last week."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet", "content": "It seems to me that the word alignment here is a fantasy. We have unequivocally proposed to extend the debate to reach an agreement, which brings me to my second question. Last week, the issue of assistance to people with disabilities was also a pressing concern, and it's even more so a week later. The Bloc proposed to extend the discussions and split the government's bill in two to help people with disabilities. Why is the government refusing this assistance to people with disabilities, when it could have been debated with the opposition in a civilized and proper way in a Parliament in which it has a minority?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "That was exactly what we wanted, but unanimous consent of the Chamber was required to debate this matter, and the Conservative Party of Canada voted against it. Unfortunately, we are going to have to find a different way to help people with disabilities."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet", "content": "If the idea is so good and wonderful, why not start over and open the dialogue now? What's stopping the Prime Minister from being a rallying point and inviting us to take to each other and resolve the problem, rather than saying that he is going to pack up his toys and go home? The people with disabilities are the ones who will pay the price. Where was the Prime Minister on October21,2019? He received a minority mandate from Quebeckers and Canadians. Why is he behaving like something between a prime minister with a majority and a monarch by divine right?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "I've heard the Conservative Party and the Bloc Qubcois throw their accusations around. They don't point out that the House of Commons did indeed give its consent to extend the mandate of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic until the end of June. Three parties agreed, which was the right thing to do in the context of this minority government. We've been working with the other parties. However, as they did not get the results they wanted, they complained. Unfortunately, they too are part of a minority Parliament and must respect the voice of the majority of parliamentarians, just as we do."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet", "content": "I might have been tempted, but that's unlikely to happen because the Prime Minister isn't me, he's him. It's therefore up to him to bring people together, open a dialogue and recall Parliament. All we were asking for was the opportunity to talk for an hour or two. However, suddenly he doesn't want to play anymore. It's not working anymore, and there's something a bit strange about that. In addition, the government wants to buy the right to interfere in provincial and Quebec jurisdictions for $14billion. However, Quebec and a number of provinces are refusing to allow it to interfere in their jurisdictions and are asking that this money be paid to them unconditionally. Is the Prime Minister trying to take advantage of the crisis or is he trying to create a constitutional crisis?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Mr.Chair, the safety of Canadians is the responsibility of all levels of government. That's why we have proposed a $14billion agreement to ensure that all Canadians across the country experience a safe re-opening of the economy.

According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, there is no reason that he cannot provide the fiscal update during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the PBO has published a number of reports himself.

Eight weeks ago, Minister Freeland said, I have had many discussions with leaders in our forestry sector and the provinces about what we can do to support the industry today. Meanwhile, we've had support going to the arts and we've had support going to fisheries, just to name a few, but arguably for the industry that was having some of the most numerous challenges, it has been radio silence.

I've heard from parents across Mississauga that they're being forced to stay home because of inadequate child care and that they have to choose between putting food on the table and keeping family safe. More and more employers are realizing that good employees are unable to contribute to their business growth because of this challenge.

In addition to that, the Prime Minister has already indicated that child care will be part of the $14-billion pledge to provinces and territories to assist them with respect to COVID-19 recovery efforts. Over the next decade, we will continue to invest $7.5 billion, and together we have achieved the goal of over 40,000 affordable child care spaces. We are also committed to continuing to create over 250,000 before-school and after-school child care spaces for kids under the age of 10.

As a parent and a care provider to a vulnerable person, she's not comfortable with physically returning to work.

With Bill C-17 looming in the background, Krystal is worried about jail time and fines if she does right by her child and her father by applying for CERB. Can Krystal reasonably refuse to go back to work and collect CERB, or will she be considered a fraudster? That's my question for the minister that is specific to Krystal's case.

If you go back and review that tape, and I would invite you to do so, you'll see that I said the AR-15 and other weapons like themreferring of course to military-style assault weaponshave been used in mass killings, and I actually cited a number of examples.

Bill Blair", "content": "That's an excellent question, Madam Chair, because it's very important to provide Canadians with clarity. We have prohibited these firearms for non-law enforcement and non-military use. The military uses weapons that were actually designed for soldiers to use in combat to shoot other soldiers. That's the appropriate use of such weapons, Madam Chair. They're not things to be played with in civilian society."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Alex Ruff", "content": "As a soldier for 25 years, I'll remind Mr. Blair that none of the currently prohibited firearms would be used in the Canadian Armed Forces. I asked him a question on whether any of them is being or ever has been used in the Canadian Armed Forces. Are any of the recently banned firearms still in use, or have they ever been in use, in any military in the world?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Madam Chair, I think it's important to also recognize that the basic origin, the provenance of the weapons that we have prohibited, was in their original design. They were designed for military use for various military forces around the world. As I've said previously, they were designed for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers. They're very efficient in their design for killing people. They have no purpose in Canadian society."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Alex Ruff", "content": "As someone who has used many military-style firearms and who is actually involved in helping define what we purchase in the military, I would use none of the ones that are currently prohibited.

Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Veterans Affairs)", "content": "Madam Chair, I appreciate my honourable colleague's question, and yes, we've indicated that it's a major priority.

My question is about summer camps again. Three weeks ago, I asked this government if the finance minister would meet with the beleaguered summer camp sector. Summer camps, which are a social and economic mainstay in Parry SoundMuskoka and all of northern Ontario, have been crippled by the global pandemic. It's costing millions of jobs, and some camps are actually in danger of folding. Aside from a brief follow-up conversation over the phone with the junior minister, there has still been no action from this government. When will the Minister of Finance meet with summer camps to find a solution?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Ahmed Hussen", "content": "Madam Chair, I recognize the honourable member's important question and his focus on summer camps. We recognize the importance of looking at that and paying attention to the needs of that community. We will continue to engage with them, as we have, to ensure and find ways in which we can get their feedback and find ways in which we can support them. That work is ongoing, and I assure the honourable member that our focus is on the kids and on ensuring that they have access to summer camps for this year."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Scott Aitchison", "content": "I don't know why you need to find ways to get feedback. The summer camps association has given lots of feedback and my office has given lots of feedback, so I don't see what's confusing about this. However, I've become accustomed to not really getting answers to questions, so I will go to the next one. The Ontario government's regional reopening plan permits cruise boats to resume on Georgian Bay, yet the federal government is refusing to allow these vessels to operate until July 1. Therefore, small businesses such as the Island Queen cruiser in Parry Sound, which has only a very few precious weeks to operate in the first place, is losing yet another two weeks because of federal inaction. This not only hurts the cruise boat industry but also hurts tourism and small businesses all through our area. Will the Minister of Transport take a regional approach himself by lifting the federal ban on Georgian Bay, just like the Province of Ontario has done?"}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Carol Hughes)", "content": "The honourable minister may reply. Is there a response?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Madam Chair, there is. I apologize for the confusion. Let me respond, if I may, on behalf of the Minister of Transport. There have been a number of very important discussions with the provinces, in particular with the Province of Ontario, around provisions regarding pleasure craft.

He said that whoever was going to fill in for him would have an answer, but again, that was not really an answer. The next issue I would like to bring this government's attention to is the deplorable state of rural Internet service in Parry SoundMuskoka. Quite simply, there are too many gaps in service, and what is available is generally way too expensive. We have families trying to work and teach their kids from home on unreliable and outrageously expensive Internet service, and we have too many small businesses that either cannot access or afford reliable Internet services. Today Greg Rickford, the Ontario energy minister, and Laurie Scott, Ontario Minister of Infrastructure, announced $2.3 million for seven northern Ontario broadband projects.

Later, the meeting also agreed about the PDG's contribution to special kids and more able and talented streams.

However, Llyr Gruffydd AM questioned that research by Ipsos MORI and the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods had shown that there was some kind of blurring.

Using the same measuring method, in 2017, there was a re-widening of the attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those not on free school meals.

The reason seemed to be there was a widening of gaps when it moved from primary to secondary, but also it was from foundation phase to key stage 2 to key stage 3 to key stage 4.

Thank you. And welcome again. If it's okay, we'll move straight into questions\u2014we have quite a number of questions to get through this morning. Firstly, Llyr."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair, and good morning. I just want to start by asking about your perception of how schools are using the pupil development grant funding, and to what extent they are genuinely targeting that funding exclusively towards children eligible for free school meals."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Thank you for the question. This grant has been targeted far better by now than it was originally. Estyn has made several reports regarding the effectiveness of the grant, and, really, going back to before this specific grant, to a similar grant, called RAISE. At the start of this grant, the funding was often spent on tackling underachievement, rather than dealing with the underachievement of children who are eligible for free school meals specifically. But, over a period of time, we have seen that it is targeted much better by now. That's not to say that the targeting is working perfectly still, and I think that we are seeing examples where the targeting isn't going just to children who receive free school meals. Schools sometimes interpret poverty in a slightly wider way than that. In terms of what schools are doing with the grant, we have given evidence to you of the kinds of things that they are doing. They are tracking progress of pupils, they are trying to improve attendance, they are trying to work with families and the community in general, they're doing work specifically to improve how\u00a0children are doing in exams, in key stage 4, specifically\u2014a lot of funding is being spent on that\u2014improving the confidence of students, taking students on extra-curricular activities, improving literacy and numeracy. Those are the kinds of activities they're being used for."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Because the research by Ipsos MORI and the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods has shown that there is some kind of blurring\u2014I think that's the term that they use\u2014in terms of who is eligible. But you are relatively comfortable with the fact that there is sufficient targeting happening. You referred to the fact that it is used, perhaps, to reach a slightly wider cohort than just those who are eligible for free school meals, but you do feel that that balance, from your experience, is acceptable."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes, certainly, it has improved a great deal. When I was looking at this initially, the targeting wasn\u2019t happening at all. It was being spent on children who were underachieving, and one of the things that we did notice in the first report was that much more funding was being spent on boys than girls. And, of course, that raised the question immediately that it wasn't being spent then on children who are eligible for free school meals, because those\u00a0numbers are equal. So, it wasn\u2019t, but it has improved. There is a discussion about who exactly should have it and whether free school meals is the best definition. So, I think that schools are perhaps not following that exactly, but within the spirit of the grant, I think I\u2019m fairly comfortable. There is a specific question\u2014I don\u2019t know if you are going to ask this\u2014regarding more able and talented pupils."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "That's where I was going next."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "So, if there is a cohort of pupils who are missing out on this, they are the more able and talented pupils who receive free school meals. There are a number of reasons for this, I think. One of them is that there\u2019s still some feeling that less able children should be receiving this grant, children who are underachieving. Schools don\u2019t always identify underachievement of those more able children. It seems that they are doing okay, but if they were given more support, they would do even better."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So, is it a lack of awareness of the nature of the grant, and that the individual has to be targeted rather than just those who are underachieving? Is that the problem? Or is it the regime that focuses on exam results and the need to draw those pupils who are underachieving up, rather than incentivising those who are achieving\u00a0to achieve better?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "A bit of both, I'd say. And the third factor is identifying children who are more able. I think that we have a bit of work to do in that regard. I was in a conference for headteachers last week, where there was new data being discussed, and that data showed the progress of children from a certain point, year 6 tests. I think that kind of data will be very useful, because what that data can do is help secondary schools to identify\u00a0more able children and that they are underachieving. Even though they're doing quite well, that kind of value-added data is very useful. So, I think that that will help as well."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Mark, did you want to pursue these matters further?"}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Yes. I just wanted to ask about the more able and talented stream. It was good to read in your report an increased emphasis on this and to see your awareness of its importance in the PDG as well. Can I just ask\u2014? Would you look at one area regarding\u00a0schools' engagement with the Seren network, particularly\u00a0for the more able and talented, and what more Estyn can do through its inspection criteria and otherwise to encourage this from schools?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, I think Estyn has always been very strongly focused on improving the performance of more able pupils. For example, in last year's annual report I raised it, and a lot of the debate around this now, I think, was generated by some of the things I've said in previous annual reports. We gave a lot of evidence to the\u2014. Paul Flynn, I think, did the\u2014no, who did the report? Paul Murphy did the report. So, we gave evidence to that. And on Seren, I'm particularly proud that my alma mater, Jesus College, is a very strong supporter of the Seren work. So, I'm personally quite interested in the work of Seren. And we look at the performance of more able pupils in all our inspections.\u00a0It's a particular part\u00a0of our inspection framework\u2014looking at the relative performance of different groups. So, we look at the different performance of boys and girls, free school meals and non-free school meals, ethnic minorities, but we also look at the performance\u00a0of more able pupils in particular, and we question schools about how they provide for the more able pupils, and we've referred to Seren in several of our inspection reports."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "And where schools work particularly hard to engage with Seren and take up opportunities from that and push as many pupils as appropriate to work with that, is that something that you would recognise within your inspection reports? And, on the other side, where schools\u00a0don't do that, is that something you would\u00a0pull them up on?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes, we've done that. We've done it in several reports."}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "Throughout our inspections, we are looking for best practice, because part of our strategy is always to identify where there are weaknesses, but actually to point schools in the direction of where they can find a solution. So, capturing different approaches to more able and talented is part of the role of inspection."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Just briefly, you touched earlier on using the measure of those who are eligible for free school meals as a way to identify children from disadvantaged backgrounds so that you can target this funding. Varied evidence has been given to us on this. Do you have an opinion on whether that's the best way?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "It certainly is a good way of doing it. There is a strong correlation between children who underachieve and that measure, so it is a strong measure. But, there is scope to discuss how exactly it does work. For example, some people say that if you have received free school meals for a period of time and now you're not receiving them, then perhaps you should still be receiving the\u00a0funding for a period of time, for example. So, there are ways of fine-tuning\u00a0that measure, I think. It's worth considering those approaches."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Thanks for that. We move on now to Michelle."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. You've reported that the proportion of schools making effective\u00a0use of the PDG remains around two thirds of secondary and primary schools, meaning that a third are still not using that PDG effectively. Why do you think this is?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think that sort of proportion broadly corresponds to the schools that don't have particularly good leadership. I think, ultimately, all of these sorts of initiatives come down to strong leadership and effective leadership\u2014that they know how to organise and use those grants effectively. One of the shortcomings that we often identify is evaluation\u2014that money has been spent on a particular way of using the grant, but it has not been evaluated well. So, I think quite a lot of it is to do with generic leadership skills. But those are some of the specific shortcomings to do with evaluation."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Are there any patterns by region or type of school in that?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I don't think there's any patterns that we've identified in terms of region."}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "As Meilyr said, it's very strongly linked to leadership capacity."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. What are the most effective uses of PDG, from your point of view? Is there something in particular that you think that schools should be focusing on?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think there's a lot of evidence on what constitutes good practice in this area. There's the Welsh Government guidance, there's our guidance, there's a lot of research\u2014the Sutton Trust toolkit\u2014and they're the sorts of things I mentioned earlier. I think that more attention does need to be given to the community-focused element of this work. So, schools do a lot of things\u00a0that they are in control of\u2014the things I mentioned earlier: things like improving attendance, offering extra-curricular activities, literacy and numeracy support, tracking pupils\u2014all those sorts of things. But an important element of this, I think, is engaging with the learners, but also with parents and the community. I think what we've found is that the most effective schools\u2014the ones that really do make a big difference to this cohort of students\u2014are the ones that do that most effectively."}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "I think that there are different situations in different schools, but in the best schools, they evaluate the barriers to learning for their particular children. Often we see that engagement with communities is part of that engagement with families. In Brackla Primary School, in Bridgend, they've got Families at Brackla, and it's a range of activities to engage with families. Families often have had a negative experience of education themselves, and the schools are trying to address some of those concerns. Cefn Hengoed\u00a0in Swansea, which I'm sure many of you know about, have had an extensive strategy for engaging with the community, with the families, and equipping their children to participate in decisions around the curriculum, making them more confident learners. So, it is about removing the barriers for disadvantaged learners."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Thank you. You've made the comment that secondary schools are focusing too much on key stage 4 and not enough on developing pupils' skills in a sustainable way. Can you expand on that and give us a bit more detail on that, please?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes. I think this is sort of generally accepted now. The latest guidance on the grant now says that 60 per cent of it should be spent on key stage 3. I think that acknowledges this general point. But what a lot of schools did with this money was precisely that, to target key stage 4\u2014to have catch-up homework clubs, revision clubs, specifically to get children better GCSE results, and getting C grades, in particular. Of course, that is an important part of your armoury of tools to use, but I think there was too much use of that. Part of the problem with that is that it doesn't either develop the long-term transferable skills that those pupils have, or should have, nor does it produce the kinds of skills that the teachers need as well. So, it's kind of a quick win, a quick-fix solution, while what we feel would be more effective in the long term, and more sustainable in the long term\u2014because if this money goes, then those quick fixes won't be possible\u2014what would be more effective in the long term is to improve the curriculum and the pedagogy, the quality of the teaching, the quality of the curriculum, so that children are naturally enthused by what is on offer, that they attend better because they want to be in school, that they want to learn. So, we feel that getting the curriculum right, tailoring the curriculum to the needs of the pupils in that area, and improving teaching, is a more sustainable long-term solution."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Do you think there's anything in particular driving the focus on the key stage 4?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, again, I think most people would say it is the performance indicators. I think there's a general acknowledgement of that. Again, I said last week\u2014. There was a conference of all the secondary heads in Wales, and that was one of the major discussion points in the conference: how do we get the performance indicators right so that there are no perverse incentives in it?"}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "To what extent are decisions being made in schools concerning the application of the PDG\u00a0actually evidence-based? To what extent are they using research to back up how they're using the PDG or is it effectively just guesswork?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think that, of all the areas of school policy, this is the one that's most evidence-based. I think that, generally, schools can do much more about using evidence and research findings, but this particular area is probably the one that schools are strongest at using research in. That's partly because the guidance strongly suggests that you should do that, but also because there is a lot of easily accessible research evidence available. So, there's a lot of research on this. As I mentioned earlier, the Sutton Trust toolkit is a good example where researchers have really tried very hard to simplify all the evidence that exists in a way that schools can use. So, there are little pound signs to show how costly an intervention is and little stars or something to show how many months of gain pupils get out of this particular intervention. So, it makes it much easier for schools to make a decision. But I think what's missing is that you can't just take that evidence as it is, because you have to implement it in your own school, and that then will affect how effective that particular intervention is. Just because it is evaluated by researchers as being generally very effective doesn't mean that you will necessarily implement it effectively. So, it is therefore important that each school does evaluate. So, there are kind of two sides to using research. There's looking at research, but there's also doing your own research and evaluating how effectively\u00a0you have implemented something. I think that's been a weakness."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Hefin David."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Do you think there's an attendance crisis at key stage 4 for those students eligible for free school meals?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "'Crisis' is maybe too strong a word, but I think there's been a lot of attention given to attendance, quite rightly. Over a long period of time, I was a member of the\u00a0national behaviour and attendance review board under Ken Reid about 10 years ago.\u00a0So, there's been a lot of attention on attendance, and that's very important because attendance has a very strong correlation with outcomes."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Of those students at key stage 4, 35\u00a0per cent of those eligible for free school meals are attending for 95\u00a0per cent of the time, whereas it's 60 per cent for\u00a0their peers.\u00a0Is the PDG making an impact on that? You've mentioned engagement with the curriculum. What more can be done?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think what's happening now is that people are targeting their attention on attendance. Attendance\u00a0has improved in primary and in secondary generally. It has also improved for these cohorts as well, and at a faster rate than the rest of the cohort. So, there have been improvements. Nevertheless, I agree with you totally that it is a major, major problem, and that is why schools\u00a0do use the PDG specifically to improve attendance."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But you said they've not used it well enough."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Did I say that? They are using it, and attendance has improved, and the attendance of this cohort has improved more, but there's still a major, major problem. So, I think there needs to be even more attention\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, what\u2014? I'm looking for\u00a0specifics. What can be done\u00a0with the PDG?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think, as I said earlier, that these are major social issues. So, I think what can be done that hasn't been done currently is to give more attention to the community-focused side of schooling. I think the schools that have done well, that have really improved attendance of this particular group of pupils, are the ones\u00a0that have taken community relationships very, very seriously and worked with parents."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Yes, you mentioned working with families when you were answering Llyr.\u00a0How does that happen, though? What does it look like? If I'm a parent, what does it look like?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Okay. I'll ask Claire to give you an example. Cefn Hengoed is a good example of a school\u00a0that has not cracked it but made a lot of progress."}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "Often, in the best schools, the headteachers consider themselves to be community leaders as well as headteachers, and they often set up arrangements where they engage directly with the families of disadvantaged children or children who are underachieving generally.

How does that get spread?"}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "Well, we've done it in a number of ways. Obviously, the first thing we do is the inspection report, and we highlight the practice there. We also have things\u2014. This is an example of our best-practice case studies. We also have conferences as well, where we invite the headteachers from those schools to come and present to other headteachers. We also tweet, use social media, to try and get the message out there.

When we had a conference, and when we looked at leadership and improving schools, Cefn Hengoed, along with a number of other schools, presented, and we had\u00a0very positive feedback from that. So, it is actually schools learning from other schools, and I think the work that the consortia have been doing on school-to-school support as well can contribute to it."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "We're spreading the PDG very thinly now, if we're talking about attendance, and then we talk about exclusion as well. Is it possible that it can have an impact on reducing the higher exclusion rates for EFSM students?"}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "I think it has the potential to. I think all these strategies have a potential to remove those barriers. But this is\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "It doesn't sound very convincing."}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "But it is a difficult challenge for schools. These are often complex issues that schools are grappling with, and they are trying a variety of approaches."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. I'm not being overly critical, but it does seem very hit and miss, to me. Some of the answers that you're giving\u2014they seem to be giving certain examples, but there doesn't seem to be a coherence to it."}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "I think it comes back to leadership. Where we have very strong strategic leadership in schools, they are more direct in their approach, and they have a very strong strategy. Where there's weaker leadership, sometimes they are trying different things, perhaps in more of a scattergun approach, rather than trying strategies, evaluating and finding out what works. There is an element of the impact of leadership there."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay, Hefin? Okay."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think it is true to say that it's difficult to distinguish what some of these better schools do with PDG, as opposed to their general money. If that's what you're getting at, I would totally agree. Schools like Cefn Hengoed will be using more than just the PDG to do this work."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And it appears to be a lot about the way things are done, as much as how the money is spent."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Absolutely."}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "It is to do with the ethos and the culture of the school."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay, thanks for that.\u00a0We have further questions from Michelle."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. You've observed that the attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those who aren't on free school meals hasn't closed significantly at any stage of learning. Is the PDG actually working?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, I'm in danger of repeating myself now. It's quite difficult to identify the cause and the effect in terms of the PDG. So, where there have been improvements, it's quite difficult to say, 'Well, that's definitely down to the PDG', and similarly vice versa: if it's not working, it's difficult to say that it's because of PDG not being used properly.\u00a0To come back to something else I said previously, there have been small improvements. Whether you say that that is due to PDG or not is quite difficult, but there have been some improvements. But there hasn't been a major step change in closing that gap, that is true, and I think the conclusion that I draw is that these are major societal challenges and barriers that these young people face. Schools can do a certain amount, and of course they must do a certain amount, but to have a step change you do need to engage with the learners, with the parents and with the community and that's why the more successful schools do actually succeed\u2014it's because they do that. So, I think more of a push on that area at a national level would be welcome."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "In most successful schools, how much is the attainment gap being narrowed, in the schools that make the most effective use of PDG?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, that would vary from school to school. We can look up specific examples for you of specific schools if you like."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Yes, perhaps you could provide a note to the committee on that."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes, I could have a list of schools and how much they've closed, perhaps."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Okay, I'll move on."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Perhaps you could include in that what you would consider to be a significant increase."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Okay. Fine."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Thank you. In 2017, we saw a re-widening of the attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those not on free school meals. What effect do you think the Welsh Government's changes to performance measures have had in terms of impact?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes, they definitely had a direct impact on it, and probably there might well be an indirect, longer-term impact as well. But, clearly, changing the performance indicators had a direct, immediate effect, because some of those examinations, qualifications, courses that were typically followed by this cohort of students weren't any longer part of the headline performance indicators. So, you've all heard about BTEC Science and the key skills qualifications. Those sorts of things that many of these pupils used to succeed at, and therefore get the performance indicator for the school, no longer count. So, it's had a direct impact, and it's one of the reasons why it's quite difficult to compare the results of one year and another, because of these changes in performance indicators."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Yes, that makes sense. Do you think there hasn't been any\u2014? Can we take it from what you've said that there's been a positive improvement, or has it been negative?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think there's a growing realisation that secondary schools,\u00a0key stage 4, is driven overly by performance indicators, and, whatever performance indicator you come up with, there will be unintended consequences. So, it's not, I think, useful to keep changing the performance indicators and think that you will get to a point where you solve the problem. That's not likely to happen. What needs to be done is to have a different approach to accountability that doesn't put so much attention on these performance indicators, because what you're doing is you're just moving the problem around by changing the performance indicators. Some of these vocational courses that I mentioned are a good example of this. So, I think the previous performance indicators encouraged schools to enter, for example, whole cohorts to do BTEC science, and that's not a good idea because the GCSE sciences are better\u00a0preparation to go on to A-level science, for example. So, you're cutting out the possibility of progression for those pupils.\u00a0On the other hand, by discouraging\u2014the new performance indicators discourage BTEC and now people are saying, 'We're not offering BTEC at all', and it is suitable for a certain cohort of pupils. So, it's very difficult to get the performance indicators absolutely right if you put so much pressure on schools to actually achieve those performance indicators."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Michelle, I'd just like to bring in Darren at this point."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "I share some of your concern around the unavailability now of BTEC in some schools. It strikes me that the decision to discourage the availability of BTEC, which is what the performance measures do, really is sending a message about vocational qualifications that is not helpful, actually, to many young people for whom vocational qualifications may be perfectly suitable. Is that something with which you concur?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think it's one of the unintended consequences, and what I'm trying to say is that, almost inevitably, there will be unintended consequences. So, you can sympathise with the original decision to change the performance indicators in such a way that it encouraged more pupils to do GCSEs, for example, but it does have that unintended consequence. In theory, there's nothing stopping a school entering pupils now for those qualifications."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Michelle, we need to move on at this stage, so we'll move on Julie Morgan."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes, thank you very much. I wanted to ask you about looked-after children and adopted children, and how effective the PDG has been for those groups of children. So, to begin with, how well do the schools know that the PDG does exist for looked-after children and adopted children?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think what we found\u2014we did a review of looked-after children fairly recently, and we found there was some confusion about where the grant was, who had the grant and how it was spent, and what the priorities of regional consortia were, because I think the grant goes to regional consortia now. I think previously it went to local authorities. So, I think schools aren't quite sure about how it's spent and what the priorities are."}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "I think we've seen a bit of improvement there. Meilyr was right; there was a lack of clarity. Schools weren't always aware of the grant and the possibility\u00a0of using it to support those learners. But the consortia are now using the grant, and there's some training being offered to schools around emotional behaviour and attachment training. There's some school-to-school work that is now being funded by the grant to share best practice, and there are some individual bursaries to support the work. So, from quite a concern, some action now is appearing to be done."}, {"speaker": "Simon Brown", "content": "And on other developments, regional consortia, they've have appointed regional LAC co-ordinators, which has been helpful\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "For these particular groups?"}, {"speaker": "Simon Brown", "content": "Yes. It has happened since July 2016 and they're now in post and beginning to work. And, as Claire said\u2014she gave some of the spend that the regional consortia are using, targeted spending. It's an improving area of regional consortia's work. They are improving their tracking of looked-after children. There's an issue about adopted children, I think, because, currently, the pupil-level annual school census data doesn't differentiate whether children are adopted or not. So, they're\u00a0more difficult to track. But looked-after children are being tracked by the consortia. So, it's an improving area, as Claire mentioned."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Could you give some examples of some work that's been done with looked-after children that you feel has been effective?"}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "I think we'd probably need to go away and get that from our evidence base. That would be helpful."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "That would be great if you could do that and send something in to us. I've mentioned before in this context that this\u00a0previous committee, in the previous Assembly, did an inquiry into adopted children, where we met with a lot of adoptive parents. And one of the big issues that did come out was the fact that there was a great deal of concern about some of the insensitivities in the schools in dealing with adopted children, asking\u00a0for pictures of when the children were born and things like that that didn't show a degree of sensitivity. Do you feel that those sorts of issues are being addressed on a wider basis now, and are they being addressed through this grant, through the PDG grant?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "We probably do need to come back to you with some more evidence on this. This\u00a0is certainly\u00a0on our radar. We've got two pieces of work currently that we're doing, which\u00a0will give a little bit more evidence on this. We're doing a piece of work on managed moves and I think that will be helpful\u00a0because a lot of these pupils are subject to managed moves, and that's the sort of thing we'll be looking at in that report: what information is transferred from one organisation and from one school to another. I think that generally hasn't been very\u00a0helpful, and there\u00a0isn't necessarily a good system for exchanging particularly their educational needs\u2014some of the basic things about their date of birth and whatever are transferred, but their educational needs, when children move from one school to\u00a0another. So, we've got a report coming out on that.\u00a0The other piece of work we've been doing is on children who have had adverse experiences in their childhood and how schools deal with those traumatic backgrounds."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "That would, of course, be much wider than looked-after and adopted children."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "It is wider. It is wider. That is wider. But, if you don't mind, we'll try and get you something\u00a0specifically on\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "If you could, because there does generally seem to be a lack of knowledge\u00a0about how effective this\u00a0work is with looked-after and adopted children. You don't have any information about exclusion rates, for example, with\u00a0looked-after children, and the\u00a0way this grant has been used to address those sorts of issues?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think there is some data available. I don't think exclusions have gone down particularly for that group more than any other group. But\u00a0there has to be quite a bit of caution used with data on exclusions. The Welsh Government's statistics on that come with\u00a0a big cautionary note, because that data is subject to a lot of variation\u2014exactly\u00a0what you're talking about, I think: different counties and different\u00a0authorities do things differently. And I think the work we're doing on managed moves is very pertinent to that because managed moves don't count as part of the exclusion. So, the exclusion rates will differ from area to area, depending on the policy on managed moves."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Right. And what about attendance? Anything\u00a0about attendance with looked-after children? Any evidence of\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I'll have to look that up as well I think."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think, Chair, if we can have some more information on all of this, it would be great."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay, yes, we'll look forward to receiving that further information from you. Mark."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Could I just ask a follow-up to a response that we had last week when we had the EAS consortium in, amongst others? They told us that the specific grant\u2014the pupil deprivation grant\u2014principally for looked-after children, they were\u00a0responsible for, and that\u00a0certainly the vast bulk of\u00a0that was spent on a specific programme, aimed not at\u00a0LACs specifically, but at all children considered vulnerable at times of transition,\u00a0particularly into year 7. Does that\u00a0strike you as an appropriate use of that grant?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think transition is appropriate\u2014that's quite sensible, but clearly if the grant is for looked-after children, it\u00a0should be spent on looked-after children."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Are there any other comments on that approach? I think, to take up what EAS has said, there were\u00a0difficulties about having\u00a0particular programmes aimed specifically at individual looked-after children, and it was felt that\u00a0they would benefit vulnerable children, who had more transitions between schools\u00a0perhaps than others. Is that a sufficient link to justify how that grant is spent? I think this is\u00a0really in the wider context of how much schools need to make sure this grant goes towards the\u00a0group it's specified for, and to what extent it is acceptable to blur the boundaries of that and\u00a0perhaps this is just an example of a higher degree of blurring than some others."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I don't know enough\u00a0about this particular initiative to comment, but I would have thought that looked-after children is a very small group and if you were to blur it that much, then it\u00a0wouldn't be very targeted. I would have thought that if the grant is\u00a0specifically for looked-after children, it\u00a0should be more targeted, but I don't know the details."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Just following up on\u00a0another point, I think you said that the 'PLASS' data\u2014. I apologise that I'm not familiar with the abbreviation, but could you explain if anything was being done to address\u00a0previously looked-after\u00a0children who are now\u00a0adopted and seeking to ensure that they are measured to that data to allow proper tracking. Is that work that's in hand, do you know? Could you just clarify for me the 'PLASS' description and what information system that that refers to?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "That's the information that schools give formally to Welsh\u00a0Government and every so often, the data that is collected\u00a0formally by Welsh\u00a0Government is improved and expanded. Exclusions is a good example. Previously, exclusions weren't collected through PLASC\u2014the pupil level annual school census\u2014and so we\u00a0had no proper data at all on exclusions. Now that's been improved, but I'm afraid I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to here."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Well, I think what you were referring to\u2014. I think you were saying that previously looked-after children who are now adopted, unlike looked-after children, that wasn't tracked by the PLASC data."}, {"speaker": "Simon Brown", "content": "That's our understanding. Looked-after children are differentiated, but whether they're adopted or not\u2014whether any\u00a0children are adopted\u2014isn't picked up in the data at the moment."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "But I think for the grant, it's\u00a0previously looked-after children who\u00a0have since been adopted rather than all\u00a0adopted children, isn't it?"}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Again,\u00a0perhaps you could clarify that for us\u00a0in the further information that you will provide."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Although, you'd probably be better off asking the Welsh Government directly."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Yes, I agree\u2014I think that would be better, but\u00a0just to\u00a0clarify finally from me, Chair: is your point that, if that\u00a0group isn't measured, then it is difficult to target them with this grant,\u00a0and if we want them to be targeted with this grant, we\u00a0should ensure that they're tracked through that data system?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes, that sounds sensible."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Mark, I think you have some further questions on Schools Challenge Cymru."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Yes. Did you\u00a0consider that the Schools Challenge Cymru programme was a success?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "It was certainly variable. It lasted for a relatively short period of time, so it's quite difficult to be definitive about the evaluation of it, but it was certainly variable. It varied from school to school. Some were very successful, some didn't make as much improvement. If it had lasted longer, maybe it would have made a difference. Overall, the data made\u2014. There were improvements overall for the 40 schools over and above the general improvement that there was for all schools in Wales. So, you could say\u00a0that\u00a0it was successful in that respect. So, it's quite difficult to say whether it was successful, because that was a fairly limited improvement for quite a lot of money. It is, you know, quite a difficult judgment to say whether it was successful or not overall. What strikes one, I think, was the variability in the success of it, and I think that was clear also at an operational level. It was clearly more successful in certain areas where all the various people involved in the work worked together effectively. So, the challenge adviser and the local authority and the regional consortia were all working effectively together. And, in other cases, they weren't, and there had to be changes in personnel and that sort of thing. So, it was quite variable."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Of the five schools within the programme that Estyn actually inspected in the last year of the programme,\u00a0I think that three of those were in special measures and two required significant improvement. Doesn't that suggest that, as far as Estyn engaged with the programme, your evidence was not to suggest that it was being successful?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Not wildly successful, certainly, but many of these schools would have been in those sorts of categories in the past as well. So, it's not very surprising that many of them still remained. So, it wasn't a huge success, clearly. As you say, many of these schools are still struggling schools, so\u00a0it hasn't been a panacea."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Bearing in mind your remarks earlier over the focus on key stage 4, in particular\u00a0the C to D grade\u00a0boundary, what sort of minimum length of time should a programme like this run for if we are to expect success?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "That's a hugely difficult question to answer, and it is at the core of whether this initiative was successful. There has been research, and people have looked at things like the City Challenge and have suggested that two or three years is too short a period to make a proper evaluation of how successful those particular initiatives were. I don't know of similar evaluations to that particular point in Wales for the Schools Challenge Cymru, but with similar initiatives in England,\u00a0the suggestion has been that you need at least three years to be able to evaluate it properly."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "The Schools Challenge Cymru advisers, I understand that Estyn met with those termly through the programme. Can you explain how useful that engagement was, and also perhaps compare or contrast it to the ongoing engagement you\u00a0have with the advisers from the regional consortia?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "You know, the engagement we had with local authorities, and regional consortia, and with Schools Challenge Cymru advisers\u00a0was not really a problem for us. That was fine. I think the engagement with each other was more of the issue, really. I think the challenge for Schools Challenge Cymru was that it was introduced at a time when regional consortia were just beginning.\u00a0So, you had a period of time when it wasn't entirely clear what the responsibilities of regional consortia were, compared\u00a0with local authorities. That has developed and\u00a0clarified over time, but at that time it wasn't entirely clear. Plus, you were bringing in another player to the school improvement landscape. When all of those different agencies worked well together, then that was a positive\u00a0thing for schools. When they were all saying the same thing, having that extra resource, extra money, extra attention, was a positive\u00a0thing; but, clearly, in some cases, that relationship\u00a0didn't always work, and some schools felt that they were being told different\u00a0things by different agencies. Clearly, that\u00a0was one of the reasons why\u00a0that wasn't\u00a0as successful."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "So, is Welsh Government now trying to do, through the regional\u00a0consortia, what it was then trying to do through Schools Challenge Cymru?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, what you had then was you had all three: you had local authorities\u00a0and regional consortia and Schools Challenge Cymru. So, what you have now is a clearer demarcation\u00a0of who does what. I don't think\u00a0what Welsh Government\u00a0are doing now is the same as what they were trying to do in Schools Challenge Cymru, because\u00a0I think what Schools Challenge Cymru did, and did well, I think, was identify that there are a small number of secondary schools that have particular challenges and they need over and above the normal local authority/regional consortia\u00a0support, they need over and above that a certain quantum of support and resource. I think that's specifically what Schools\u00a0Challenge Cymru was trying to do, and that's not quite the same as what the more universal provision of regional consortia is."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay, that's all we have time for in this session, I'm afraid. There are some questions that we haven't reached that we'll write to you on to obtain further responses, and there are some matters that you've identified where you need to provide us with further\u00a0information also. May I thank you very much for coming along this morning to give evidence? You will be sent a transcript to check for factual\u00a0accuracy in the usual\u00a0way. Thank you very much. The committee\u00a0will now break for just over six minutes until 11:30. Welcome back, for item 3 on our agenda today, scrutiny of Estyn's annual report for 2016-17. We've got a number of areas to cover, but please, Members, feel free to raise whatever issues you think appropriate, because\u00a0the areas that we've identified are a general guide only. Okay, welcome back to Estyn, our witnesses for this session also. I don't\u00a0know if we need further introductions. I don't think we do, really; we've already had that on the record. So, we'll move straight into questions then, and Llyr."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Thank you very much. Just to start with, what's your opinion about the way the Government has been introducing reforms in this area over this past inspection cycle? In general, what is your opinion about how effective that has been and how much of an impression has it had?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well the seven year cycle encompasses three Governments if truth be told, but there has been a sense of continuity and progress made in the nature of policy work in general, starting with the fundamental things such as literacy and numeracy in the first instance and also behaviour and attendance, as I said earlier this morning. And then they've developed a far more comprehensive scheme that is at the heart of the development of the curriculum and pedagogy specifically. And I think that that general shift from the foundations\u2014of literacy and numeracy\u2014moving towards the curriculum and pedagogy does make sense. And the other trend that we've seen is to promote collaboration and the self-improvement system, as it's called. I also think that there are a number of progressive countries doing the same kind of thing. So, I think that the general direction is right."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So, you think\u2014and I'd agree\u2014that the focus on pedagogy is correct and that this culture that appears to be putting more emphasis on self-improvement, and so on, is a positive\u00a0one. Are there aspects that haven't worked as well in your opinion?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Of course, one accepts that one would like to see development and progress happening\u00a0far more quickly, but, even in that instance, we need to balance the need that we all have to see progress with the pressures that are on teachers\u2014there are so many things changing. I think that the most striking aspect in looking back over the past seven years is that all aspects of work in the education system\u2014I'm trying to avoid saying 'schools', because it's more than just schools; it's colleges and the system as a whole\u2014have changed.\u00a0All aspects of that have changed, and I think that we need that\u2014all of those aspects need to be changed and improved\u2014but we need to balance that against the fact that we need to not go so fast, because workload on teachers\u2014. This responsibility of self-improvement means that there is more pressure on teachers and headteachers, ultimately. That's why Estyn was very pleased to collaborate with 15 other bodies to give guidance on workload for teachers, because we have to be very careful to get that right as well."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "But is it disappointing, then, in the latest annual report, that you are to all intents and purposes coming to the conclusion that the performance is consistent with how it has been over the past inspection cycle? Would you not expect some kind of progress or something more significant in terms of outcomes?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "That's one way of looking at it. Another way, as I said earlier, is that all of these things are changing and, under those particular circumstances, that it's a good thing that teachers and the education system have been able to maintain standards and the quality of education."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "The sector, of course, is continually evolving. We know that a number of these reforms are still playing out and are still being developed and introduced. Of course, there is a risk that we are in this situation continuously, and therefore settling for managing to maintain, for me, perhaps wouldn't show enough ambition. Is there a risk that we will find ourselves continually\u2014? As you say, the inspection cycle has seen three Governments. There are changes and different policies and priorities being implemented. From what you say, that does prevent the development of the sector."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "We are in the middle of a period of major change, and you're right that there is more change to come. The new curriculum will reach key stage 4 in around seven years again, so we're genuinely in the middle of this period of change. Perhaps 'revolutionary' is too strong a word, but it is the biggest change that I've seen in my career. You have to go back to the 1980s and 1990s to see similar changes. Of course, we all wish to see swifter progress being made, but what that means in practice is that you push more changes through, or that you push through the changes that we currently have more quickly. There was discussion, for example, about when the new curriculum should be introduced. Those are the kinds of practical questions that arise, and you have to remember that, in the classroom, what you will have are individual teachers having to prepare for a new GCSE, a new A-level, and there are new specifications in that regard, and it's a great deal of work. So, we have to be very careful when we say that we need to accelerate that process."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "But you understand the point I was making about the risk of finding ourselves like this continually and therefore to say, if we were to interpret your conclusion in the recent report, that outcomes have been consistent over the inspection cycle doesn't mean that we are pushing enough or that the reforms happen in a way that allows progress in performance terms."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I would wish to see that we wouldn't be in this position continuously. I think that\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "But you've just suggested that there are seven years ahead of us yet in terms of introducing these reforms."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "But I do think that the reforms, in looking at them holistically, are fundamental, as I was saying. You have to go back 30, 40 years to see something similar. So, I do think that we need to look at\u2014. One of the problems\u2014. You ask what hasn't worked in the past. Well, I think one of the things, and it's difficult to answer that question, but one of the things that hasn't worked in the past is just doing one aspect of the system. We need to look at transforming the entire education system\u00a0at the same time,\u00a0because if you just tinker with one part then it might have an unintended effect in another place. So, I think we need to look at the system as a whole, and I think that what's happening at the moment is a structural change to the system."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Yes, I think that's a fair enough point. What's your assessment, therefore, of how able or how ready schools are to deal with, in moving forward now, all of these changes and reforms?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, as I said, I think that they have coped with a whole host of changes, and that's something to be praised. We are disappointed the standards haven't improved as much as we would have liked to have seen, but we also need to be congratulating the workforce for getting to grips with so many changes in a relatively short period. So, that does give one confidence that they will be able to cope with other changes in future. So, I am confident in that sense, but we do have to be careful in looking out for the workload, because the culture of promoting is one of giving more responsibilities to teachers, to schools, to colleges and to headteachers. So, we have to be very careful that that workload doesn't become excessive."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Would you also share the concern that the reduction in school budgets will worsen those risks that you referred to?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes. As you'll know, international research evidence shows that it is not the amount of funding that goes into education systems that dictates how effective they are. But it is true to say that, if you have financial cuts, that does cause practical problems for headteachers in having to lay off staff, and so on. So, it does take a lot of time and energy to deal with cuts."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Thanks."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Diolch yn fawr, Llyr. Mark."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Could I ask the reasons for Professor Donaldson being asked to undertake a review of Estyn's role?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes. I think any good organisation would welcome external scrutiny. I would say that, wouldn't I, because I'm an inspector, but I think it's important that we practise what we preach. There have been in the past systems of quinquennial reviews. I think it is healthy for anybody to have that sort of external view, and I think in particular we're proud in Estyn that we are a body that is developing and trying new things and evolving continuously. So, I think it's that. But if you were to ask, 'Why now?', it's because of the extent of the education reform that we're particularly facing. So, I think it's a good thing to do at any given time, but considering the range and speed of change that we're facing in education now, I thought it was particularly important that we ask Graham Donaldson to look at the implications for our work of all this education reform."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "What have been the biggest benefits to Wales of having Estyn as an independent body inspecting schools and other institutions in Wales compared to the work that Ofsted has done in England?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, we have very good relationships with Ofsted and with Education Scotland and the Education Training Inspectorate in Northern Ireland. I wouldn't like to compare\u2014I don't think it would be fair to compare ourselves. We do things slightly differently, but we benefit a lot from each other. We have inspectors from Ofsted or from Scotland, from Northern Ireland, on our inspections. We shadow them, and our inspectors go to their countries. So, we're working quite closely with the home countries, but also further afield with Holland and with the Republic of Ireland, for example.\u00a0So, we're always, all of us, learning\u00a0from one another about what we think they do well and what they think we do well. We're constantly learning from each other. I wouldn't think it's fair for me to say what I think\u2014you know, where we're better than another country."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Of course. I'm not asking you to criticise Ofsted. I agree that wouldn't be appropriate. But I think what is fair for me to ask is: perhaps could you highlight one or two areas where you believe that Estyn has a particular\u00a0difference of emphasis and approach from Ofsted?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think one of the things we've done and we've developed over many years\u00a0is the use of the nominee and peer inspectors in particular. So, we've got, I think, a really good tradition of doing that in Wales, and when we do meet other inspectorates, they're always very interested in that part of our work. We're a very small organisation; we're only about 50 HMIs. We inspect a wide range of sectors, as you know, but the bulk of that inspection work is actually\u00a0done now by peer inspectors. So, I think that, and the idea of a nominee, is also of interest to other inspectorates across the world. So, there's always someone from the body that we are inspecting on the inspection team. They're part of all the discussions so they actually understand how we've come to our report, and they can then help the organisation move forward after we've left."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "I've clashed with Welsh Ministers on the absence of league tables for schools in Wales, with less accountability for their results than is the case in England. I note it as a parent myself. But, from, I think, at some point in 2014, you started in your inspection reports of primary\u00a0schools putting the comparison of how they were doing compared to other schools and local authorities\u00a0and nationally, as well as what you've described as their family of schools, and being more transparent over their key stage 2 results. So, what led you to do that? What difference has that made? And was that decision taken by Estyn on its own account, or was that something\u00a0that was agreed with Welsh Ministers?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I did listen to Plenary, so I've heard you raise this issue. I'm sure it's inadvertent\u00a0on your part, but you've confused absolutely\u00a0everyone with this."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "I'm pleased to let you set the record straight, then."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "It's not actually true. The data that you refer to is published by the Welsh Government on My Local School. So, if you want to know about your own school or any other school, you should go onto that website. That's hugely\u2014. It's very clear. There's a huge amount of data on it, but it's very, very clear. You can look at it in terms of tables and data and graphs and it shows all that data that you refer to, and that's the right place to have it. We do refer to some of that data in our reports, because\u00a0our reports are based on evidence. Most of it is first-hand evidence that we see in the classroom and see in pupils' work, but we triangulate that with data and with what parents and pupils say and interviews with staff. So, we refer to that data and we always have referred\u00a0to the data. Pre 2014, it was in the body of the text, and then after 2014 we put it in an appendix. We had a mid-cycle review and people felt it would be better in an appendix than in the body of the text, but it was always there. There's pros and cons on whether it should\u00a0be in the body of the text or in an appendix."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Well, certainly, the data became clear to me in reports after 2014 in a way it wasn't before. So, I will leave that there. Can I just highlight a few of what I felt were either particularly striking statistics\u00a0or comparisons\u00a0or points that were made in your annual\u00a0report of potential concern? You state that headteachers do not understand the principles of good pedagogy or good practice in about three quarters of schools\u2014this relates to the foundation phase. I find that quite a shocking statistic. Do you share that view?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes. That's why I highlighted it in my foreword. I think there is a general consensus about the benefits of the foundation phase. There's a lot of research, and our own evidence shows that, where it is implemented well, pupils benefit a lot from it and they're well prepared to be independent\u00a0thinkers. So, it's a development that we should be proud of in Wales, I think, the foundation phase. It's a great thing. But, we are disappointed that only about a quarter of primary schools are implementing it fully. There's a whole range of reasons, as I discuss in the annual report, why that might be the case.\u00a0It is quite an innovative idea, and I think it's misunderstood by saying it's learning through play, because that's a bit too simplistic a definition of it. We have written a report recently on good practice in the foundation phase, so that we can try and explain clearly to people what the benefits of it are and how best to implement it. But I think it is true that too many headteachers\u2014. Many of them might not have taught in foundation phase, they might not have that infant background, they might have a junior-school background. There might not have been enough\u2014well, we say there wasn't enough training\u2014or there might be people who missed any training that there was then. So, overall, there is a large number of leaders who don't fully appreciate what the foundation phase could deliver."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Darren\u2014is it on this?"}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Yes, it is on this. I was just wondering\u2014. I mean, one of the problems that I know you've identified in the past is this lack of good practice being able\u00a0to travel into all parts of Wales, and, of course, we've got local authorities, we've got regional consortia, we've got the Welsh Government\u2014all of which want to see good practice replicated where possible. What opportunities are there, perhaps, to develop some other further opportunities for good practice to be shared and promoted? I know that the Wales Audit Office, for example, has its good practice exchange. Is there something\u00a0similar that schools can engage with to make things happen?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "It's a good question. I mean, specifically to do with foundation phase, there is a foundation phase\u2014I can't remember what it's called now\u2014excellence network I think, which is being relaunched. I think it was supposed to be relaunched during the snow period. So, there are networks being established. There's one for mathematics\u2014a national network for excellence in mathematics\u2014there's one for science and there's one for foundation phase in particular. So, I think it is a challenge that we haven't cracked yet in Wales: how do we make sure that\u00a0good practice does travel?\u00a0I think one specifically for foundation phase is a good idea, because we've got a specific issue with the foundation phase."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "When you say that\u2014"}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Mark, just before you go on, I think Julie wanted to come in on this point as well."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes. I just wondered if you could give us some examples about how the foundation phase is not being implemented in the true spirit of the foundation phase in the three quarters of schools that you think fall\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, what we mean by that is schools not necessarily teaching badly, but in a more traditional way. And where we've seen that most obviously is in year 1 and year 2. Some schools actually reverted, after the\u00a0introduction of the new tests, from what was pedagogy that was in line with the foundation phase. And basically, if I understand it correctly, it's more to do with the children making their own choices about what they do. And that is pretty common in nursery and reception classes, but it's less common in year 1 and year 2."}, {"speaker": "Claire Morgan", "content": "I think it is very much, as Meilyr said, the difference between a pupil-led learning experience or a teacher-led learning experience.\u00a0Because of the lack of training and maybe the confidence to pursue that active and experiential learning approach, teachers have tended to resort to what they feel more comfortable with, which is more of an adult-led learning\u2014often still high quality, but it doesn't ensure that the learners become far more independent, far more engaged in their learning. So, it's almost holding children back to an extent. They're making good progress, but they could be making even more progress."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Mark."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "So, when you say that some teachers are sort of holding children back,\u00a0and in the report that three quarters of schools don't understand the principles of good pedagogy or good practice, what you mean is that teachers are using traditional methods, including whole-class teaching, rather than moving towards a pupil-led learning experience and one that you said was oversimplified as learning through play. May not the issue here therefore be that Estyn is seeking to impose this different approach on teachers who think that they are better able to teach children in the traditional way, which, at least in my experience, would be supported by quite a number of parents?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I don't think it's Estyn that's\u00a0imposing it. That's the national policy."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Do you support that policy?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, we do, actually. We do. Our evidence, as I said, is that, when it is implemented properly, pupils do actually gain from it. But we're not imposing it, and what we're saying is that headteachers are not necessarily understanding it. I think there is quite a lot of jargon around it. I was just looking in the annual report. Quite unusually, in this section, we have had to actually explain some of the technical terms, like 'continuous provision'.\u00a0So that's, I think, one of the reasons why people don't understand it fully. That's why we did produce this quite substantial bit of work, trying to unpack what this actually means in practice and giving a lot of good examples of the practice."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "You referred to evidence of this approach working. Given the timing of when it was brought in and where we are now, has that really had time to distil through the system and give compelling evidence that this approach works better than more traditional approaches?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I think it has, to be fair. I think this has, because we're talking about a lot of developmental work related to the foundation phase prior to 2010, but it became compulsory for all schools to deliver it from 2010 onwards. So, that gives enough time for children to have been through the whole of the foundation\u00a0phase onto key stage 2, and we can see the effect of it. In the schools where there is good practice in the foundation phase, we can see the effect when we inspect on key stage 2 children."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "So, would you be confident about this, in the next few years, feeding through into an improvement in Programme for International Student Assessments, rather than a further deterioration?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes. I think that if we did what Darren was talking about, getting more schools to share good practice, I think it will expand and more schools will take it on, yes."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Okay. On the sharing of good practice, you put emphasis in the report on this being an improving area and trend for the future as well, but I think you did raise concerns that it wasn't monitored or evaluated sufficiently well, particularly where one school was supporting another. How should that be done better?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, I think this has been a theme of many of the issues we've raised: that, whatever the initiative, you can't tell whether it's been successful or not unless you evaluate it properly. So, those evaluation skills, I think, are very important. I think that, with the development of the\u00a0national academy for educational leadership, I would hope that research skills and evaluative skills would be part of the kind of training that headteachers get that maybe in the past they didn't. So, that becomes more of the day-to-day work of schools\u2014that naturally, whenever you do something,\u00a0you evaluate it afterwards.\u00a0We've evaluated a lot of the school-to-school work. We've published two or three reports on it, and we've identified what we think is good practice and not-so-good practice."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay, Mark? If we move on at this stage\u2014I wonder, before other Members come in, if I could ask about community-focused schools. Quite a lot of what we discussed earlier was around the importance of getting families and the community more involved in education, and one way of doing that, I think, is through community-focused schools that are very much accessible to the community, linked well with outside organisations, having an extended school-day offer. We have the\u00a0twenty-first century schools programme, but\u00a0we have a lot of schools existing that haven't been part of that. I just wondered to what extent Estyn might encourage or highlight the need to encourage greater consistency in community-focused schools across Wales, because I think there is a feeling that it is very inconsistent."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes, we would very much be happy to support anything like that. We discussed it earlier. We were\u00a0talking about targeting vulnerable learners earlier this morning. We see that as, particularly, a solution for that long-standing issue we have in Wales in particular. So, yes, we do have good examples of good practice. We mentioned some of them earlier this morning. I've puzzled about this. I think there was a bit of a misunderstanding about the term 'community-focused school'. I think it became thought of as meaning the community just uses the facilities in the evening and, of course, it's a much, much broader concept than that. I think some schools particularly didn't like the community using their facilities in the evening, and that became, I think, possibly part of the reason why community-focused schools didn't become more popular. The way I look at it is, as Claire was explaining earlier about the school offering all kinds of services to people\u2014you know, family learning, those sorts of nurture groups, all those sorts of educationally focused services available from the school, and generally building relationships. They're more to do with the culture than the actual building and the facilities. But, yes, we certainly have seen and identified where that good practice exists."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "So, if there might be a mechanism that could have community-focused schools working in the way that you've described right across Wales, would Estyn be in favour of such a mechanism?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Absolutely, yes."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Could I just ask one further question, then, before, as I said, I bring other Members in? There is a particular concern at the moment\u2014and has been for some time\u2014about white working-class children, and perhaps particularly boys, not attaining as they should through our education system. Is that something that Estyn recognises? Has Estyn done much work on that, and if so, what is that work?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "We've done work on boys and girls, and we've done work on deprived children\u2014you know, identified, as we were discussing this morning, by eligibility for free school meals. We haven't specifically looked at white working-class boys, but a lot of the solutions, and a lot of the good practice that we have identified generally, through the PDG and whatever I think is the way forward for that particular cohort as well."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "So, you wouldn't see the need for a particular focus or a particular piece of work\u00a0to identify whether there are aspects of education that might particularly\u00a0benefit that group."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I wouldn't object to doing a piece of work on that, in case we have missed something, but I suspect it would be the same schools that do well with that cohort that we've identified already for the same reasons, I suspect."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Michelle."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Thank you. To what extent has the rate of improvement\u00a0differed between the primary and secondary sectors?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "I'm not sure if there's been a difference in the rate of improvement, but certainly I've raised in this annual report, and indeed in previous annual reports, the difference between primary and secondary. We've got 7 in 10\u2014nearly three quarters\u2014of primary schools doing well and about half of secondary schools. So, I did open debate on why that is the case in last year's annual report. There are several reasons, I think. Generally, there is a widening of gaps when you go from primary to secondary, but also it's from foundation phase to key stage 2 to key stage 3 to key stage 4. There's a general widening\u00a0of the gender gap, for example. There's a widening\u00a0of the free-school-meals gap and so forth. So, there are particular\u00a0challenges facing secondary schools that don't exist in primary. I should say that what you get in secondary schools is greater variability. So, there's actually more excellence in secondary schools according to our inspections than in primary, although the overall proportion of good or better schools is higher in primary than in secondary. So, I think it is a challenge to think why this is the case. It's partly because\u00a0of the challenges of adolescent, young people. That is part of it. I think also, although I've got no evidence for this, it's probably\u00a0more difficult\u00a0for that community focus to work in a larger secondary school than a smaller primary school. You go to primary schools, you often see the parents much more engaged than in secondary school. So, I think that's a bit more of a challenge as well. So, there is a whole range of issues. The other one,\u00a0of course,\u00a0is the one we were talking about earlier this morning, the pressure on secondary schools to address performance indicators and examinations in particular. Another possible reason is the structure\u00a0of secondary schools is subject-based, departmental-based, so children will get 10 to 12 different teachers. In primary school, for a whole year, they will have the same teacher. It's easier, therefore, in a primary school for the school to see the child as an individual\u00a0and recognise their problems and their needs as a whole. So, I think there is a whole range of issues that explains or goes part way to explaining\u00a0what you've identified."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. You touched on this quite\u00a0a bit in your earlier evidence, but you said in the annual report that there's a danger that accountability measures might be having an effect on the advice being given to pupils about subjects they study. Do you have any evidence of that or is that a perception?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Well, I think everyone agrees that there's very strong evidence about that. We discussed examples this morning. When you change a performance\u00a0indicator, the examination pattern changes. We talked about examples like BTEC science this morning. There's a very, very direct and immediate impact on them. There's plenty of evidence\u00a0of that."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay, Michelle?\u00a0Perhaps we'll move on at this stage\u2014we haven't got a great deal of time left\u2014if that's okay. Julie."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I wanted to ask about special schools in terms of your views about the standards in special schools\u2014whether you've got any views on that."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes, we highlighted special schools as a successful sector in the annual report, as we have over\u00a0many years. Over 90 per cent of them are good or better. It's a very successful sector. The small number of schools that don't do quite as well tend to be the schools that deal with children with emotional and behavioural difficulties. But the sector as a whole is a good example of sharing good practice. They work very, very well together. They're constantly\u2014. It's difficult to say why that is in this particular sector, as opposed to other sectors. Possibly they don't have an overlap in catchment areas, they're quite geographically\u00a0separate, so they don't feel as if they're in competition with one another. But they certainly work very well together, sharing good practice, doing peer reviews of each other. So, it is a successful sector."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "And that includes the independent sector."}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Sorry, I should have said that was mainly to do with the maintained sector. The independent sector tends to focus maybe on those children with emotional and behavioural difficulties, so they have the more difficult task to begin with. But because they're independent, they are, to some extent, in competition with one another. So, we have seen improvement in that independent special sector over the cycle. That's partly down to the work we do in Estyn. We visit them on an annual basis to make sure that they're addressing all our recommendations, and continue to meet the needs of those pupils. And also, I think there's been a trend where more of those independent schools now have\u2014. Several of them have the same owner, so they share good practice amongst that little chain of schools. So, that has been a trend we've seen over time as well."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Right. And what about pupil referral units? How are the standards there?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Yes, they're more variable. I think they have a lot of challenges. We've contributed a lot of evidence to the various working groups that have been looking at EOTAS\u2014that's education other than at school. Half the children in EOTAS\u2014educated other than at school\u2014are in PRUs. So, we've done a lot of work about that. ADEW, which is the\u00a0Association of Directors of Education in Wales, have now set up a national body to share good practice amongst PRUs, so I think that is a very positive step forward, because that sharing, I think, wasn't happening with PRUs. I think what we need to do with PRUs is to get them to be more of a part of the education system as a whole. They tend to be sort of semi-detached a little bit from the system. So, the more we can do to involve them in national events, and also, I think, make their governance more like that of a school so that they become more similar to schools\u2014that makes it easier for them to share practice with schools."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay, thank you very much. Llyr."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Thank you. I'd just like to spend a minute or two looking more specifically at post-16 education. The percentage of further education colleges who have reached a\u00a0 good or better standard has increased, of course, over the past inspection cycle. I'd just like to ask what you think is responsible for that, and are there any lessons we can take out of that and transfer to other sectors within education?"}, {"speaker": "Meilyr Rowlands", "content": "Thank you for the question, but I'm going to ask Simon to answer."}, {"speaker": "Simon Brown", "content": "As you're aware, the number of colleges\u00a0from 22 to 12, and I think those mergers resulted in establishments that were stronger in terms of their leadership in particular. That leadership, I think\u00a0the characteristics we have seen in the 'good' or 'better'\u2014as you say, 80 per cent leadership good or better\u2014has been a culture of openness, a culture of clarity of purpose about where the college is going. High staff morale has been maintained, because a number of those colleges\u2014. Obviously, if you're merging large colleges as they did in north Wales, keeping staff morale high is quite a skill, and I think\u00a0the leadership have done that very well. They've also supported managers at all levels, and they've encouraged managers to support staff at all levels. So, it's become a very collaborative, very supportive organisation. I think another characteristic of the FE sector is that\u00a0it's got very strong governance arrangements. I did a training\u00a0session for college governors about a month ago, and what struck me was the breadth of experience of the college governors, from industry, from academia. They are a very\u00a0challenging set of governors, I think, who hold the senior leadership\u00a0to account in the colleges, and that helps to push standards forward. Teaching is 'good' or 'better' in 70 per cent\u00a0of colleges because the\u00a0senior leadership team are encouraging\u00a0teachers in colleges to innovate, encouraging them to engage actively in performance management\u00a0systems, and to become reflective practitioners in the colleges. And this is impacting, obviously, on the standards at the end of the day. So, I think those are the key features."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "And how many of those do you think could effectively be transferred or encouraged in other sectors?"}, {"speaker": "Simon Brown", "content": "But I think one sector that\u2014. I think the other post-16 sector, which is work-based learning\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Well, yes, I was going to ask you. Conversely, of course, there's a different experience\u00a0there."}, {"speaker": "Simon Brown", "content": "Yes, there is a contrast. And we do have concerns about work-based learning. And, again, those concerns tend to sit mainly with the leadership. As we said in the\u00a0annual report, standards are 'good' or 'better' in only 50 per cent of work-based learning companies, mainly because the completion rates of learners are not what we'd expect, the progression that learners\u00a0make isn't what we'd expect. And that is mainly\u00a0due to the way in which the leadership teams monitor progress\u2014monitor progress in themselves\u00a0as a provider, but, more importantly, the way they\u00a0manage sub-contractors, because, as you will already know, there's 19 lead providers; there's about 100 training providers. And the companies that are doing better, or the training providers doing better, are those\u00a0that have got a firm grip on their sub-contractors, and, most importantly, they put quality as the top part of any agenda at any meeting. And, of course, if you're challenging your sub-contractors about\u00a0quality, that will impact\u00a0on standards of teaching, and, hopefully, ultimately, on standards of performance on the learners. And I think, to go back\u00a0to your original question, Llyr, the sort of leadership models that FE colleges have, I think\u00a0some of the work-based learning providers would be wise to start to emulate those. It's beginning\u00a0to happen, because\u00a0FE is getting more engaged in the work-based learning world, so I think some of those behaviours will start to rub off on the companies."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So, who would you look to drive some of those changes through then? Is it the sector themselves,\u00a0 or to what extent can Government and others do things?"}, {"speaker": "Simon Brown", "content": "Well, as you know, Meilyr alluded\u00a0to the changes across all sectors. We've got PCET\u2014we've got the post-compulsory education and training\u00a0reforms under way. The Welsh Government is looking at the implementation of Hazelkorn's recommendations. So, ultimately, that will start to drive the sectors closer together in post-16. But I think, in the shorter term, some of the work that groups like Colegau Cymru and the National Training Federation Wales\u00a0are doing, sharing best practice, bringing the colleges and the training companies together, is beginning to help. I'm going to the national training federation conference tomorrow in Cardiff, and I notice the attendance there\u2014there's a lot of FE colleges attending, senior staff of FE colleges, as well as from the work-based training companies. So, that sort of osmosis of good practice is beginning to happen quite naturally."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay, Llyr? We haven't got very long left, but we've got five minutes or so for some further questions from Hefin David."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "With regard to local authorities, you found shortcomings in your 2010-14 inspection in 15 of the 22. And one of the things that struck me in the report was where you said that you found ineffective processes for self-evaluating improvement within those authorities, but you've also said that there's been a high turnover of directors and\u00a0new\u00a0directors in place in\u00a0many of them. Has that had a\u00a0positive effect on that self-evaluation process?"}, {"speaker": "Simon Brown", "content": "As you're aware, over the past three years, out of the 22 authorities, there have been 40 new directors, over the past three years. Those directors have got a range of experience. Some of those directors are very experienced. Other ones have come from headteachership fairly recently. So, that's one factor.\u00a0I think the other factor is that the status of education\u00a0directors has changed quite significantly.\u00a0Some local authorities are a member of the corporate team and they are\u00a0directors of\u00a0education and children's services, so they've got very broad portfolios. In other ones, they're being treated more like heads of service, so heads of\u00a0department level."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I know that Caerphilly went in the opposite direction\u2014from having a chief\u00a0education officer to then appointing a director, I think."}, {"speaker": "Simon Brown", "content": "I'm sorry?"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "In Caerphilly county borough, they went from having a chief education officer and now have got a\u00a0director again. But, in many cases, they're the same people, aren't they? It's\u00a0just that their roles are changed."}, {"speaker": "Simon Brown", "content": "Yes, it's the changes as the\u00a0corporate structure of councils shift and change. I think the other thing that's happened, of course, with the role of\u00a0the\u00a0director of education, is, because of the regional consortia now\u00a0doing the school improvement function, a large chunk of that role has now moved to the consortia. So, I think it's early days to say what the impact of that new cohort of\u00a0directors will be, but, of course, we're starting a new inspection cycle in September. We don't do pilots. We looked at Neath Port Talbot in December; we looked at Denbighshire in February. Those\u00a0reports are not yet published, but what I can say is that neither of those\u00a0authorities are in follow-up."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But you said, even though it's not in follow-up, it was still showing signs of not being able to reflect effectively on improvement\u2014in\u00a0the report."}, {"speaker": "Simon Brown", "content": "Not in those two authorities."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Right, okay, but some of those not in follow-up were not\u00a0reflecting\u00a0effectively on\u00a0their improvement\u2014is the statement that\u00a0was made in\u00a0the report."}, {"speaker": "Simon Brown", "content": "What we're seeing, and we've seen this before in the previous cycle, is that the performance of some authorities is patchy. There are\u00a0authorities that we have concerns about. Those are the\u00a0authorities\u2014. I think I said to committee last year those authorities are ones that we held improvement conferences in last year. That was to get the senior leadership\u2014both political and officer-led leadership\u2014and the consortia and\u00a0Welsh Government\u00a0and the Wales\u00a0Audit Office and, as it was, the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales,\u00a0around the table to get those senior leadership teams to actually identify what the longer-term issues are, to surface those issues and to put\u00a0together an action plan.\u00a0We're\u00a0revisiting those three authorities very, very shortly. The\u00a0first of the\u00a0revisits is in April to see what progress they've made over the past 12 months or so."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. And, with things like the curriculum reforms, you've identified the new directors in place, but you've said that, although they're new directors, they're\u00a0actually very\u00a0experienced in education, so therefore you're confident that\u00a0they're going to manage the\u00a0reforms well as they are\u00a0developed in\u00a0the next few years."}, {"speaker": "Simon Brown", "content": "I think one development, and I've raised this in committee before, was\u2014. One of our concerns, apart from the fact that there was a large turnover of directors, was what sort of level of training senior leaders and middle managers were getting in those authorities. One of the things that I'm quite pleased to report is that the Association of Directors of Education in Wales and Welsh Government have\u00a0stepped up to address that issue. Last year, all serving directors attended residential courses run by the Staff College Wales, facilitated by ADEW, and ADEW have just finished the first round of director\u2014. The name of the course is the 'Welsh future leaders in education' course and 26 people have just finished that\u2014aspiring directors. They're preparing for another cohort in September. That course, again, is developed by the Staff College Wales, but it has a lot of external input. They're putting in directors and chief executives from Scotland, they're putting in headteachers of very successful schools in England, who've got current grass-roots experience to share with these aspiring directors. So, I think the concerns that we had previously about the professional learning for middle managers and leaders in local authorities are being addressed. The proof will be in the pudding when we start to do the inspection cycle, but at least the issue now is being tackled."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Can I just look at, then, consortia?\u00a0One of the criticisms in the report was that national policy wasn't being put in context\u2014I think that was the statement in the report\u2014in certain consortia. Can you elaborate on what you meant by that?"}, {"speaker": "Simon Brown", "content": "Yes, when we talked, we said that\u2014. Well, two things are at play. One is that the national model for regional working is being revised at the moment, and that work is ongoing by Welsh Government.\u00a0That is to bring greater consistency to the four consortia, because one of our concerns, which we\u00a0expressed in this report\u00a0and we expressed in previous years, is that, although the national model had a particular approach back in 2012, when Robert Hill did the first review, it had a particular approach to the consortia being fairly similar, over the years, they've gone in four different directions. To be fair, over the past couple of years, the consortia are now collaborating much closer together. They are working together\u2014for example, I mentioned earlier about the regional co-ordinators for LAC. Those four people are meeting regularly. So, they've all got different co-ordination roles in their regions. Whereas before they were working more in silos, they are now working much closer together.\u00a0So, I think what we were referring to, and what we were talking about in the report, is the fact that the consortia need to have a more consistent approach across all four regions. But that will certainly be driven by the new national model."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. And the relationships with local authorities, you said that the sharing of information with the local authorities is not always acted upon by local authorities\u2014from the consortia. Is that a failure of communication, or is that something that sits with\u00a0the local authority to acknowledge?"}, {"speaker": "Simon Brown", "content": "I don't think it's a failure of communication. In the cases where some authorities haven't acted sufficiently in intervening in schools or in issuing warning\u00a0letters, the consortia have been quite clear. The challenge advisers have highlighted these issues. It's the authority that hasn't acted as swiftly as we would expect it to. But, again, I think that is beginning to improve, because the local authorities are quite sensitive to the fact we are now going to be re-inspecting them and looking at them, and that is one of the issues we'll be picking up on."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. And, in order to do their jobs, the consortia need to be suitably resourced.\u00a0Are they, and are they fit for the challenges ahead?"}, {"speaker": "Simon Brown", "content": "It's not for us to comment on whether each consortium is sufficiently funded or not, but what we would say is that, generally,\u00a0in the past, they've spent perhaps too large a proportion of their funds\u00a0on challenge work and not enough funding on support work, but that, again, is moving. We've picked up that GwE, for example,\u00a0is in the process of renaming their challenge advisers 'support advisers',\u00a0because they're moving their culture more over to supporting schools to deal with all the raft of reforms that Meilyr mentioned, and that is,\u00a0it seems to me, an entirely sensible way to go."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay.\u00a0Thank you."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. Well, that brings this session to an end. So, thank you all very much once again for giving evidence to committee today. Once again, you will be sent a transcript to check for factual accuracy. Diolch yn fawr. Okay, the next item on our agenda today, item 4, is papers to note. We have one paper to note, which is a letter from the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee to the Welsh Government regarding the Hwb programme.\u00a0Is committee content to note that paper? Yes.\u00a0Thank you very much. Item 5, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42\u00a0to resolve to exclude the public from the remainder of this meeting. Is committee content so to do? Okay. Thank you very much. We will move into private session."}]}

The group was worrying that Brexit would cut down the support from the EU to the UK, thus putting the Wales Universities in great dilemma. Besides, the fact was that the less fiscal support from the EU, the less foreign students would apply for the Wales universities. The members talked about several possible solutions, for instance, adjusting the syllabus to better meet both the students' and the lecturers' needs and providing them with better career prospects.

Even though most worries were towards the \"no deal\" scenario, Huw Morris was confident that the higher education Brexit working group had been meeting since September 2016 and recently officials had been visiting individual institutions to ensure that they were fully prepared for the potential fund problems.", "relevant_text_span": [["3", "10"]]}, {"query": "What did Eluned Morgan think of further education when talking about the political background and the aim of the group?", "answer": "Eluned Morgan had been actively engaging with the FE sector and he found that those colleges are much localized, with only 71 EU apprenticeships and staff. The group was working hard to ensure that these 71 people would safely go through such a chaotic period. What's also important was that as for FE, the relationship between the apprenticeships and the working community mattered much, which means they might have to improve the relationship between these 71 EU people and the local community.", "relevant_text_span": [["16", "22"]]}, {"query": "What did the group talk about the admission problems of Wales universities and corresponding solutions?", "answer": "Hefin David pointed out that Wales was the only country in the UK that witnessed a significant drop in applications from EU students. The group should have noticed that the available funding for those EU students had changed, and that was one of the reasons why fewer of them applied for Wales universities this year.

Not until November would they conduct the first census to get an exact number of the students enrolled. In addition, Kirsty Williams pointed out the fact that international students outside the EU make up a bigger proportion of students not from the UK who came to Wales institutions.

During such a dilemma, Swansea University found a solution that provided an attractive curriculum and offered courses that people really wanted to take. They delivered their curriculum in a fashion way, guaranteed good teaching, and had an appealing infrastructure, which all made good use to attract potential applicants. That was exactly what other institutions needed to do at present.", "relevant_text_span": [["44", "50"]]}, {"query": "What did the group talk about the possible official solution to the problem with more funding, a new immigration policy and the help of the minister?", "answer": "The group laid their stress on mainly three aspects in terms of dealing with the problem at an official level, which respectively were adding more funding to the universities, implementing a new immigration policy, and asking for the minister's help. With adequate funding, the institutions would be more likely to satisfy the research needs from the students. Similarly, a more robust immigration policy might make it more appealing for those who would like to set down in Wales. Last but not least, making the minister be aware of the serious problem would also be important that the problem would then be brought to national meetings and discussed by more officials.", "relevant_text_span": [["57", "73"]]}, {"query": "What did Kirsty Williams think of the additional funding to HEFCW when discussing the funding to support Wales universities to go through the financial problems?", "answer": "When discussing the funding to support Wales universities to go through the financial problems, Julie Morgan mentioned that they have funded Wales universities with 6.4 million dollars in 2017-18. Kirsty Williams added that they had actually made an additional resource of \u00a35 million available to mitigate the freeze in tuition fees, and another \u00a35 million had been made available to HEFCW to kick-start the work on postgraduate support.

However, his attitude had changed. As the locals usually did not take foreign students as immigrants, the government should treat the foreign students and those who came from EU as the same, which is to say, a new immigration system should be set to ensure that EU students and all the other foreign ones would receive the same treatment when seeking a job in Wales.", "relevant_text_span": [["69", "71"]]}, {"query": "Summarize the official commitments to help the Wales universities to get through the transition period.", "answer": "The group mentioned that Wales government had promised a multi-annual commitment that it would help the Wales universities to get through the transition period and operate well with enough funding.

She did not think that either of them would work, however, according to Eluned Morgan, the official commitment related to capital would matter more under such a transition period.

We'll go straight into questions, then, and the first questions are from Suzy Davies."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you. I'd like to ask you both, if that's okay, a little bit about preparedness. But if I could start with higher education, I understand that\u2014I don't know, it must be about 18 months ago now\u2014Ken Skates told another committee in this place that there had been nine sector analyses done. Presumably, one of those was HE, because of the\u2014well, Welsh Government had a presence, and still does, in Brussels, related to higher education. Apparently, those have now been superseded by work that's been done by Cardiff University. I don't know if you've got any comments on that research, or whether it's been brought to your attention yet."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, Suzy, following the vote, I was very keen that we work very closely with colleagues in higher education and further education, to get an understanding from on the ground about the potential impact. So, in terms of preparedness, we started that group in the September, and that work from that group, which includes both HE and FE, has been instrumental in helping the Government form its views, which were articulated in the Government's White Paper, 'Securing Wales' Future'. There has been ongoing work being done\u2014as the debate in London and Europe becomes a little bit more clear, then it becomes a little less clear, and then a little bit more clear, but, bearing in mind the difficulties of working in an ever-changing field, we have been refining those approaches. Each institution has been looking at their own institution, because, as you can imagine, although we have an overview of the sector, the challenges are very different for individual institutions\u2014so their exposure, for instance, to the number of European Union students that they have at their college, or the work that they might be doing with Horizon 2020, or their success\u2014and there has been considerable success in the HE field in securing structural funds for various projects\u2014the exposure and the potential impact of leaving the EU, in a 'no deal' or in a 'deal' scenario, is very, very different. But I don't know if, Huw, you want to talk any further."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Maybe just to use the 'no deal' scenario is probably the easiest,\u00a0isn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "The 'no deal'?"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, yes, because that's the worst-case scenario, so let's look at that one."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "As the Cabinet\u00a0Secretary mentioned, the higher education Brexit working group's\u00a0been meeting since September 2016 and has been looking at that in general. More recently, when the prospect of no deal became talked about, officials have been visiting individual institutions to talk to them about their preparedness for that. As you'll be aware, the funding for much of the activity is secured, we believe, even under a 'no deal' scenario, until December 2020; that's a letter we had from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. I think the research you're referring to may be research that Cardiff University has been doing with the Bevan\u00a0Foundation and others. I know there's a report due to be launched later today. We have been doing our own research and looking at the impact on HE, FE and apprenticeship providers."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, that's really helpful because my understanding was that this Cardiff University research\u00a0had superseded all those nine sector analyses."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "That may be true for the economy brief. Certainly, there are published papers by Max Munday and a team at Cardiff University on the impact of Brexit on the Welsh economy, but for HE and FE and apprenticeship provision, it's as the Cabinet Secretary\u00a0outlined."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "So, are there any formal risk assessments that are available for us to scrutinise, for example? For HE and FE\u00a0for that matter."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales have been doing some specific work; I can't comment on how wide they would want that to be shared. We have been doing some broad analysis, as I said, for the sector, looking at what we can do to mitigate the risk, bearing in mind that each institution is an autonomous institution, a principle that they guard really jealously, and rightly so. So, we have been, as Huw said, because the prospect of a 'no deal' has become, perhaps, more to the forefront, officers have been visiting each institution to try and make sure and to satisfy us, as people who fund part of their activity, that they have their own plans in place to deal with these scenarios. We continue to work alongside them to push the issues that we can help them with. So, for instance, we continue to work with officials in Westminster around Erasmus+ provision in a 'no deal' scenario, what a UK stand-alone project would look like, the impacts of a 'no deal' on Horizon 2020. So, we look at the broader picture and we are encouraging continually individual institutions to make sure that they themselves are looking at their specific needs within that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, if there is something that's shareable, I'm sure we'd be very pleased to see it\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Anything that we've got\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "\u2014particularly with FE, actually, because, of course, we haven't got a\u00a0HEFCW\u00a0for FE; you're doing that regulation yourself. I'd expect to see that type of work evidenced somewhere from within Welsh Government, and we would be able to see that then."}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "So, if I could just make some points on FE. We've been actively engaging with the FE sector. We've spoken to every one of the colleges about how they see things developing. I think it's quite a different response than what is going to be\u00a0happening in HE."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, because the student thing isn't such an issue, is it?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "You've got to remember that the FE colleges are much more anchored within their\u00a0communities, they're much more localised, and so, for example, the number of EU students in these colleges is significantly lower. The number of staff in these colleges\u2014I think they've analysed that there are only about 71 people. So, we're keeping in touch with them and we're letting them know what we are being told in terms of the Home Office settled status and what we can do to protect those 71. But that's\u00a0a much bigger issue, I think, for higher education."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "What are they telling you about European social fund\u00a0funding, though, because, as you say, they're locally anchored\u2014the impact on FE of ESF funding is probably more significant than the issues we're talking about with higher education. How are you finding this out? Is this through one-to-one conversations?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "We are engaging with them all, and, obviously, we're engaging with ColegauCymru, who've done their own analysis, and what we found, in particular, is that the real problems are probably in relation to ESF funding and apprenticeships. But what you've got to remember is that that link between apprenticeships and the local work community is absolutely crucial. So, if\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, that's why I asked."}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "\u2014the economy nosedives, or if there's an issue that we see\u2014just the dislocation of companies in those areas as a result of Brexit\u2014then that will inevitably have an impact on the number of apprenticeships that will be on offer. So, it's those kinds of things, but at the moment I think it's worth pointing out that about \u00a315 million a year goes into the FE sector just in relation to apprenticeships."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Can I just come back finally on that, before handing over? In both your areas of responsibility, there's going to be an impact on Welsh Government in how it responds to that, as well. Can you tell me a little bit about the European transition team, which I think is about building resilience within the Welsh Government to deal with the impacts of Brexit? Is that a formal arrangement you have with officials? I don't really know much about this team, but it seems to meet fortnightly to get Welsh Government ready for Brexit, so could you just give us some clues on this?"}, {"speaker": "Marie Knox", "content": "Yes, in terms of the European transition team, that's the central co-ordinating group that pulls together all the leads in each department who are pulling together the work on European transition. So, I attend that group in relation to higher education and further education, and, obviously, other representatives in terms of agriculture, transport, the economy, et cetera."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "It's great that you're on that group, but what does it actually do? That's the bit I wasn't sure about."}, {"speaker": "Marie Knox", "content": "I guess it provides the governance structure for the Welsh Government as a whole in relation to European transition. So, individual departments do their own work, and the European transition team provides the governance structure, and, also, they lead on the discussions with the Department for Exiting the European Union, No.\u00a010, the Joint Ministerial Committee\u2014those kinds of ministerial arrangements."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you. I've had enough time, I think."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Llyr."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "I'll ask my questions in Welsh, if I may. This discussion between HEFCW and higher education, these challenges in terms of how ready they are for the changes to come, and the work that the Government is doing with FE, I suspect, is happening\u00a0at an organisational level. So, I just want to hear a little about where the student voice comes into that discussion and where the engagement happens in terms of the students."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "So, we have a close working relationship with the National Union of Students. I meet with them regularly, and officials are in constant touch with the student voice. They have been very clear, and I think there is a huge amount of consensus between the Welsh Government, what the universities are asking for and what the students are asking for. You'll have seen, only earlier this week, the very powerful campaign by NUS Wales about the importance of Erasmus+ arrangements. There is a huge amount to be gained for Welsh students and young people participating in the Erasmus programme. Many of us, I know, have had the opportunity to study abroad as part of our own studies, and there's a lot to be gained from it. We've been very clear from the outset, as have the sector and the student voice, about the importance of participation in that scheme.  NUS are also very concerned that there should be no negative impact on the quality of faculty. Our HE institutions, to a greater extent than FE, have faculty staff from the EU\u2014it runs at about 11 per cent. That adds great diversity and strength to the quality of teaching within our institutions. Clearly, that is a concern for students. They want to have the best teachers, they want access to the best learning opportunities, and we've been very clear about the importance of providing security and stability for those staff, making sure we send very clear messages that they're very welcome and we value their contribution. NUS, again, also value the diversity in the student population. Again, as far as we've been able to, we've been able to give messages about the security of funding for European students for the next academic year. I wish I could go further, but that's out of my hands. We're working to the limits of what I feel comfortable in being able to guarantee without further guarantees from Westminster. So, we've been working closely with the student voice, and I think, Llyr,\u00a0what's very clear is there is a consensus about what is important across the Government, the institutions and student voice. So, that is making sure we send very clear messages about Wales's institutions being open for business and that we welcome both EU and international students, that we value the contribution of faculty, and that we want to be able to continue in Horizon 2020. That's especially important if\u00a0we're looking at attracting postgraduate work and postgraduate students into our system, as well as Erasmus+. The issue of post-study work visas, again, is very important. As I said, there's a consensus, I think, between the Government, the institutions and the students about what we need the UK Government to achieve for us."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Before we move on to student recruitment, it's increasingly the view of many experts that we're heading for a 'no deal' Brexit. Can I ask both of you what specific\u00a0plans you've put in place in the event of such a 'no deal' Brexit happening and us crashing out next spring?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Well, I think it's really difficult for us to prepare for a 'no deal' Brexit, but obviously we need to think through very carefully what that might look like, and I think that scenario planning is starting to happen. I think it's very different, again, for FE compared to HE. So, in relation to FE, what we do have is funding\u2014ESF funding\u2014which the UK Government has said that they will underwrite until 2020. So, in March next year, if there is no deal, the immediate impact on FE is unlikely to hit in the way that we may have feared. The problem then becomes: what exactly is the deal with the EU in future, because we will have some kind of relationship, and what that impact will be on the broader economy and our ability to work with companies locally, and industries, to provide that link between training needs? So, the colleges, basically, are providing the training for lots of the apprenticeships, and so if the number of companies reduces, then that is likely to have an impact. So, there are specific sectors that we are more concerned about than others. Farming is obviously one that we are concerned about, because that could have a difference in terms of day one of no deal. If your markets are not there, that could be quite an immediate impact. Health and social care\u2014obviously, we are concerned that there are a number of people who work in that sector who are EU citizens. What is the impact? Are they going to feel unwelcome? Are they likely, then, to return home? Where will that skills gap, therefore, be? So, that's a problem for us. Construction is already an issue for us in terms of skills shortages. So, one of the things we're doing is we've developed these regional skills partnerships where we ask local employers, 'What is it that you need in terms of skills development?' and we are now asking further education colleges to respond to that need. So, rather than them just getting people through the college system, who are easy to get in because they're doing courses that they're excited about, let's try and encourage them to do courses where we know there are skills shortages. So, that is a new structure that we've developed that is already having an impact; there's a \u00a310 million project there. So, we're already putting things in place for those situations. In manufacturing, obviously, if there's no deal, the rules of origin, that could have an immediate impact. Just-in-time\u2014we could have real problems in terms of dislocation there; and hospitality and tourism. So, those are the sectors we have most concerns about, and all of them have very strong links to the FE sector."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "From the HE perspective, from a point of principle, we just have to keep working towards some kind of deal. Although the prospect of no deal, maybe, has risen up the agenda, we have got to be consistent in our messages to the Westminster Government: we need a deal. Wales cannot afford to crash out of the EU without a deal. If that worst-case scenario was to happen, because of the underwrite guarantee, actually, for European regional development fund and European social fund programmes in the HE sector, it would be business as usual. And because of the current underwrite guarantee, the forthcoming bids for Erasmus and Horizon 2020 would be covered, but they would be the last applications that could be made. You'll be aware that there are some proposals for an extension to that guarantee, but from my understanding and our understanding of it, that would only give us third-country status for Horizon 2020 and Erasmus. What that does mean is that we would have limited access to the Horizon 2020 programme, and if you look at the activity that is currently being undertaken by the Welsh HE sector under that programme, that would mean that we'd probably lose about 50 per cent of that work, because that's the split between the bits we would still be able to access and what we are currently accessing. As I've already said, we have made a guarantee for EU student support for the next academic year, but, without clarity from the Treasury, I don't think it would be prudent of me to commit Welsh Government to anything further than that. So, we continue to push the message that a 'no deal' would be catastrophic. What can we do? You'll be aware that we have been working with Universities Wales to access resources under the European transition fund, under the Global Wales programme, to look to boost international marketing of the HE sector and to talk about the strengths that we have in the sector. And we continue to look at other opportunities within the EU transition pot of money to assist the universities and the FE sector in that regard. We also continue to look to respond to the Reid review proposals, about how we can beef up our own research and continue to engage with UK Research and Innovation to make sure that, with any research money that comes out of that negotiation, Wales is in a competitive position to be able to bid successfully for that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We're going to move on, then, to talk about student recruitment. I'm going to, because we've got a lot of questions, appeal for brief questions and answers that are as concise as possible, please. Hefin."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "How does the Welsh Government account for the fact that EU student applications in Wales this year\u2014that Wales is the only country in the UK to have seen a significant drop?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay, well, I think the first thing to remember is that we will not get a full picture of student recruitment until, first of all, November and then the true picture, because some institutions, as you would know, have two admissions dates\u2014we won't get the full picture until the spring. I think it was inevitable, given the change in Government policy with regard to student support, which had previously allowed European students to benefit from a tuition fee grant, and given the fact that that option is no longer available to them, that that has had an impact on EU recruitment, and there's no point trying to hide from that."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, together with leaving the EU, that's a double-whammy effect that's hitting Wales harder than the rest of the UK."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "It just puts us in the same position as EU students applying to England, but it was inevitable. This was looked at by Diamond. It was anticipated that this could be a consequence of the change in policy, and I think we see that reflected in the initial figure, although, as I said, we won't get the true picture until the first census in November, and then, ultimately, the final picture in the spring."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "How concerned are you by that?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Clearly, we want our universities to be able to attract students from both the EU and from around the world. The fact that the tuition fee grant arrangements may have had an impact on European Union students at this stage does not preclude the fact that Wales, up until now, has been successful in recruiting international students. So, the change in the fee regime should not be a barrier to the recruitment of international students, because, actually, international students outside of the EU make up a bigger proportion of students not from the UK who come to our institutions."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "That's a fair point, but it's unfortunate timing, though, isn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think, from a public policy point of view and moving towards a sustainable way of funding our HE sector, then both my priority and, I would say, the priority of the institutions was to see the implementation of Diamond, which is what we have done."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay, that's fine. What about the fact that we've got a relatively imbalanced higher education profile compared to other countries of the UK with regard to high, medium and low-tariff universities? We've got one high-tariff university, and they're the ones that tend to show the growth in recruitment of EU students. Are you concerned about that balance of profile in the HE sector?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "As I said in answer to your question earlier, there is a difference reflected in the exposure of institutions to EU and international students. I would argue that it's not necessarily the case that institutions that are not high-tariff are not able to do very well in this sector.\u00a0If you look, for instance, at Swansea University\u2014if you look at the work Swansea\u00a0University has done, that shows you what is possible."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "What is Swansea's success, then? What can we learn from Swansea?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "What I think is important\u2014and this is not about any one institution\u2014what I think is really important is that we look to\u2014. And I can't force institutions\u00a0to do this. It's a combination, I believe, for all universities, of getting their offer right\u2014so, having a curriculum at their institution that is attractive and offers courses that people want to study. It's about that curriculum being delivered in an excellent fashion, so high quality\u00a0ratings for teaching, as well as having an infrastructure\u00a0that is attractive to students. So, it's all about getting the offer right and providing what students, both domestically and internationally, want."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But the evidence would therefore suggest that that model of success that you've just outlined is happening in Swansea but it isn't happening in other institutions, and they're seeing a drop."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, as I said, I think what we can see from Cardiff, Swansea and others is that it is possible to do very well in the sector."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, Cardiff, Swansea and Bangor\u2014but the others, not."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "As I said, what we can see is that, if you get the offer right, I think we have something very special that the HE sector can market itself on."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Llyr, you've got a supplementary."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Just coming back to the drop in EU students, you mentioned that one of the reasons probably is the change in the funding that's available to students coming here. So, does that suggest that, under the current regime, Wales was punching above its weight in terms of attracting students and we've lost that advantage? I know we're gaining in other ways in introducing\u00a0the new system, but really we're not much different to England in terms of fees now, so why would they come to Wales as opposed to going anywhere else?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think you're right; there was an added incentive, potentially, to come to a Welsh\u00a0institution because\u00a0of the availability of the tuition\u00a0fee grant. That advantage is no longer there, which is why we need to work alongside the sector, as we're doing with the Global Wales programme, to increase their ability to market HE in the round across the world. I think we've got a strong offer that we can speak to people about. I'm very proud of what our institutions can deliver for people. It's a fantastic, warm environment to come and study in, at great institutions. There's something for everybody, whether you want to be in a city like Cardiff or whether you want a coastal experience in a small town like Aber. So, we've got a lot to offer and that's why it's really important that, although we have seen a change in the tuition\u00a0fees, which may have an impact, we are investing with universities, for instance, in the Global Wales programme."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "In terms of the drop that we've seen in Wales, which is differential amongst\u00a0institutions, will you be taking any specific action to try and prevent Brexit exacerbating\u00a0that?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We are working with HEFCW and individual\u00a0institutions, as I said, to test their preparedness. We can't tell them what to do in that sense, but we can, because of our governance arrangements and HEFCW's monitoring arrangements, continue to test with them. I meet regularly\u00a0with vice-chancellors and separately\u00a0with the chairs of the institutions and separately\u00a0again with HEFCW representatives, and the sustainability\u00a0of the sector and recruitment issues is always something that is on the agenda."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Julie."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "The additional \u00a36.4 million that went to HEFCW in the 2017-18 year, which I think you say is partly because\u00a0of Brexit and partly because of demographic and recruitment challenges, what do you expect to see as a result of that spending?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "That funding was allocated, as I said, to enable HEFCW to deal with any short-term implications arising out of demographic changes, because\u00a0we've seen a drop in the number of 18-year-olds, and the initial implications of EU transition. It was allocated as part of HEFCW's overall grant in aid, and therefore the council was given discretion as to how it was to be apportioned to the sector. The money was brought forward\u00a0a year, because, in conversations with HEFCW and the institutions, they felt that that money\u00a0would be more useful earlier on. So, it was money that was brought forward into the allocation for 2017-18, as opposed\u00a0to 2018-19, because\u00a0they wanted\u00a0to have that resource earlier rather than later. With regard to\u00a0additional resources, you'll be aware that we have made an additional resource of \u00a35 million available to mitigate the freeze in tuition fees, and \u00a35 million has been made available to HEFCW to kick-start the work on postgraduate support until we're in a position to fully implement Diamond at the postgraduate level."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "You say that the money is used at the discretion of the universities. So, you don't have an analysis of how that was spent."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "The financial allocation, as I said, was agreed with the funding council and it was there to help universities with any cash flow issues, but if you'd like further details I can provide those as much as I'm able."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think it would be interesting if we know what the money was spent on and, of course, that money is now not available for the next financial year, so there's no way of carrying on what they were doing with it, presumably."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, as I said, it was part of the overall allocation to HEFCW. With specific regard to dealing with the impact of Brexit, you'll be aware that we have reached an agreement in principle on the funding of \u00a33.5 million to the Global Wales initiative. This was an application that came in from Universities Wales looking at specifically targeting and beefing up international work and international recruitment work to support them at this time, and we're currently working with Universities Wales on the exact details and outcomes they would expect from that investment."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "And do you have any estimate of how many students you hope to attract by that?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "That is subject to continuing negotiations with Universities Wales before we let any contracts with them. What's important is that that work is based on research that has been done by Universities Wales to look at the optimum markets that we should be targeting, specifically the United States of America and Vietnam."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "And will this money be used equally between all the universities?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We expect that all institutions\u2014should they have a desire to participate\u2014will be able to be assisted, as well as the overall global branding from Universities Wales and the new Study in Wales initiative."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Thank you. I think we've covered the EU student fees, haven't we?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Do you want to ask question 12?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Has the Welsh Government explored the possibility of looking at different immigration rules for international and EU students who may wish to study here?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. Well, with regard to immigration, clearly, this is something, at the moment, that is out of our hands, and I have to say, it hasn't got off to a great start when initially the post-study work visas were issued just for a number of institutions in the south-east of England, with no consultation with us and I don't believe with the Scottish Government either. So, we have campaigned, pushed, cajoled, lobbied, and I was very glad that in December last year, the Home Office did then make that scheme available to Cardiff and to Trinity Saint David. We continue to press the point that we do not believe that, first of all, international students should be included in any immigration targets. I think all the evidence suggests that the British public don't regard international students as immigrants, and therefore we do need to make sure that they are taken out of the targets and we can continue to press that message with the UK Government. At the moment, you'll be aware that Welsh Government has looked at a specific piece of work on whether there was any scope for specific immigration policy for Wales, although I must say that was mostly in the field of actually the workforce rather than students. You'll be aware that this week the Government's migration advisory committee\u2014there are so many committees these days\u2014have said that they don't believe that there is a case for a separate provision for EU students, as opposed to international students. But we want an immigration system that makes it as easy as possible for those students who want to benefit from education in Wales, and indeed the UK, to be able to do so."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Llyr."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So, what are we doing from now on in then? Are we just waiting to see or are we continuing to push?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No\u2014gosh\u2014Llyr, we continue to push the case\u00a0at the official level, and at the moment, I'm trying to convene a quadrilateral, if it can be quadrilateral in the sense\u00a0that Northern Ireland\u00a0aren't up and running\u2014but certainly with officials from Northern Ireland. We're trying to arrange another quadrilateral between myself, the HE Minister for England and the new HE Minister for Scotland. If I can speak candidly, I don't believe\u00a0that there's any difference between our view, with regard to the status of international students, and the views of English Ministers within the department in England. It is convincing the Home Office of that case. So, I don't think we need to persuade\u00a0Sam Gyimah about the importance of this. Jo Johnson got, I think the current Minister gets it\u2014it's a question\u00a0of whether we can persuade the Home Office\u00a0of that particular case."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. The next questions are from John Griffiths."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "I have some questions on the sustainability\u00a0of higher and further education. Firstly, with regard to higher education, we heard that, even without Brexit, higher education\u00a0is in managed deficit, whilst the funding announcements from Diamond and Reid are awaited. So, is that a concern to Welsh Government, and could Welsh Government\u00a0take away that uncertainty by outlining a clear funding commitment to the Diamond and Reid reviews?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Welsh Government is fully committed, John, to implementing the Diamond review proposals. It's a commitment\u00a0that was an element of the agreement between myself and the First Minister that\u00a0brought me into the administration, and we have been very clear with HEFCW about our expectations and what the implementation of Diamond will mean for grant going to HEFCW. And we've shared those figures\u00a0with them. With regard to Reid, we continue within Government to discuss how we can implement the recommendations of Reid, but one of the whole principles behind Diamond was to move us to a more sustainable funding settlement\u00a0for the HE sector in the round, that is fair to students, encourages those with the ability to partake in higher education\u00a0to do so, especially from those from a poorer background, as well as being able to provide our institutions\u00a0with the resources that they need."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "So, you don't accept, then, that there hasn't been a clear funding commitment\u00a0from Welsh Government to those reviews\u2014the Diamond and\u00a0Reid reviews?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "With regard to Diamond, I would absolutely refute that. We have been very clear and\u00a0we have shown HEFCW our analysis of the figures going forward in relation to what is sometimes called within the sector the 'Diamond dividend', although the Diamond dividend is never as big as people imagine the\u00a0Diamond dividend to be. But we've\u00a0been absolutely\u00a0clear with HEFCW and the sector on what that will mean. Now, with regard to Reid, those are ongoing discussions\u00a0that form part of the normal budgetary\u00a0process within\u00a0the Government, but I think we have been as clear as we can be with regard to Diamond."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. The second question, really, is about HE and FE and it's about European funding, which, of course, has been\u00a0and is on a multi-year basis, which gives, I think, a lot of security and comfort to the sectors, knowing what the budgets will be over a period of time. So, moving from that to a yearly budgeting situation would be worrying. So, would you commit\u00a0to introducing multi-year funding\u00a0settlements\u00a0for HE, and indeed for FE, moving forward beyond Brexit?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Shall I take this and give you a little bit of a break? She's not very well. I think the multi-annual nature of the European funding programmes has been very, very useful. People can plan, you can get staffing in place, you can have really strategic aims and I think that's really useful for the institutions involved. Of course, what we don't have is multi-annual budgeting from the UK Government. So, whilst\u00a0I think we would, in an ideal world, like to see a better view of what's coming our way, it's extremely\u00a0difficult for us to be able to offer that without having that\u00a0multi-annual funding commitment from the UK Government. So, I think that will be a major, major loss for the institutions concerned. Of course, it's not just about ESF and apprenticeships\u2014it's also about ERDF funding. So, you mustn't forget that, actually, there's been a lot of ERDF funding that's gone into these institutions. Swansea University, you'll be aware, has been practically rebuilt with ERDF. Also, FE colleges\u2014we've got Coleg y Cymoedd, the college in Blaenau Gwent. These have been built, largely, with European funding. It's because of the multi-annual nature of the fact that we've been able to prepare for them that they have been able to progress. So, that will be a huge loss, but I think it's really important that we don't forget the ERDF aspect in addition to the ESF impact that there will be on these institutions."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay. As far as further education is concerned, in your paper you state that it's a priority to support the FE sector to maintain all the learning opportunities that currently take place under European Union funding. So, would you be able to give the committee an idea of the level of resource you would estimate that the sector requires to achieve that priority, and\u2014? I'll stop there for the moment."}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "I think it is important. What we've said is that we want to maintain that range of learning opportunities that is provided by EU funding. I think we've got to be clear that we are not working to this scenario. I think we've got to\u2014. The UK Government have made us some promises and they've made some commitments, and we need to hold them to that, and so let's keep the pressure on. The moment we start saying, 'No, it's all going to be okay, we'll sort ourselves out'\u2014I think that would be a huge mistake. We have been promised that we will not lose a penny as a result of Brexit, and we need to make sure that we keep them to that commitment. I think it was quite interesting to hear what Philip Hammond said yesterday when he was in Wales, saying that the money that we will receive will depend on the future shape of the economy, which implies that he has no idea what's going to happen there, and that that shared prosperity fund will be designed around the deal. Well, that's really not what we're interested in. We were made some promises, and we need them to commit to those promises. I think we have some real concerns about the shared prosperity fund not really following through on the commitments that were made during the Brexit referendum. But, in terms of the replacements, we'd be looking at about \u00a315 million a year, and that would be a huge impact for us, but we're not looking at that\u2014I don't think we should be\u2014because they made some promises."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "So, could you say that, if they keep their promises, then at least that level of funding would be maintained?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "I think that would be a minimum, but that's just one aspect of it. That's not including the whole workplace learning money on top of that."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Okay."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Suzy, you had a supplementary."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, just very quickly on the multi-annual point, obviously I recognise that we're talking about six or seven-year cycles with Europe, and I completely take the point that you don't really know from year to year what your budget's going to be, but Welsh Government does make multi-annual commitments. I think you did it yesterday, actually\u2014the capital commitment is over more than one year. How are you able to do that and yet not quite feel confident that you can do that with\u2014well, both your sectors, really?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "I think it's probably easier to do with capital than it is with revenue, so that's what would make the difference. But it's\u2014. These institutions are interested in revenue, because that's what supports the staff. The one thing we all know is that employment opportunities today\u2014the transitional nature of employment and the fact that people are not getting the kind of contracts that we'd like them to get\u2014that makes their lives very precarious and they're less likely, then, to be committed to those institutions. I think it's a really, really concerning thing, because what makes these institutions work well is their staff, so that makes life very, very difficult without that multi-annual commitment."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "They also have to raise some of their own money as well\u2014we mustn't forget that."}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "No, I think that's right, and I think that there's more that these institutions can do in terms of their own funding and being more responsive to employers and the need for skills in their areas."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "So, given the precarious state of planning for the finances, are you considering letting universities charge EU students international fees?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We don't regulate the ability for universities to set fees for international students. They would be in a position to\u2014[Inaudible.] They are in a position to set international fees at a rate that, I guess, they feel is appropriate for the provision that they give to those students."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, right. We'll move on, then, to questions from Llyr."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Thank you. I just wanted to pick up on the funding of apprenticeships and the long-term funding, because the ESF\u2014the commitments take us to 2023, which takes us beyond any transition period. So, I just want to hear from you that there are assurances that the apprenticeship programme can be delivered as a whole, come what may."}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Well, we're fine until 2020, because we've had that guarantee from the Government. The issue for us is the n+2 that we would have if we do have some kind of transition deal or an agreement with the EU. So, there is a risk and there is concern, beyond 2020, that that would create problems if they don't agree to fund that, which is the expectation that we have."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "But it is a prospect that this wouldn't be achieved as you foresee."}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Well, we do hope, because we've had the pledges and commitments from the Government, that they will respect what we expected and what was expected by these institutions that have had the commitment of the funding."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So, to what extent does that undermine the current work? Because institutions want to enter into agreements with providers and so on. Businesses want to know, if they're starting on some sort of journey, that they are going to get to the end of it some years down the line. That must be undermining a lot of the work that's going on now."}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Well, as I said, because the guarantee is there until 2020, I think that, for now, people are willing to go into those agreements, and I hope that we'll have a better outlook by November of the direction we're moving in. But I don't think it's had an impact. You have to remember that the number of apprenticeships in Wales is rising, while they've collapsed entirely in England. So, it is important that we do continue, and it's important that we don't create an atmosphere here that's going to undermine the confidence of our employers in committing to training in the workplace."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Are you confident that the Government will achieve its targets in this context?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Yes. We're on target to reach 100,000 apprenticeships. I think we're slightly ahead of that target, I'm pleased to say. So, of course, our hope is to do that. But let's be clear: if there is a 'no deal' scenario, that will have an impact on the economy, and who knows what will happen then to some of these companies that are reliant on the EU."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Talking about the impact on the wider economy, on the point you made earlier that it's not just the direct effect on these institutions, but also on the businesses that they engage with, that is a concern in this context, that means, of course, that there is a lot of pressure in this context on the work that other departments in the Government are doing, because perhaps they are the ones dealing with some of this. So, could you tell us a little bit about how you're working with Ministers and Cabinet Secretaries and other departments within the Government to safeguard these interests?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "So, as part of the employability programme, I have started going round every member of the Cabinet to ask what the impact will be on them\u2014for example, in health, and, certainly, the economy, but here are many other areas. What's important for us is that we do collaborate and we do get this analysis, but we hope to do that on the ground through the regional skills partnerships. That's our way of ensuring that we can have an understanding, on the ground, of what's needed by employers. And so ensuring that people feed into that and that we respond to those requirements\u2014that's where we're focusing our work. So, we're asking, for example, health boards to ensure that they feed into the regional skills partnerships."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Is there a danger that we're a little bit behind in this process? Because Brexit could be upon us in no time at all, and, of course, this work is still ongoing."}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Well, I have been pushing and ensuring that in the direct areas facing the greatest risk, and agriculture's one of those, of course\u2014. We have been pushing to see what we can do further, so, for example, I'm in the process of developing a policy on rural skills at present because I do think it's important that we do focus on those sectors that are likely to suffer the worst impact if the worst does happen. So, those preparations are in place as far as they can be, but, of course, it's very difficult without knowing to what extent it's going to impact on us."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "And each sector's running on its own timescale, I would presume. But, as you've mentioned rural skills, when do you foresee that that work will appear, and when will plans or schemes or whatever you're intending to put in place see the light of day?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Well, we hope during this term that that will be published or announced. So, certainly, it is something that we have been discussing with people in rural areas directly, with the colleges, to see what the provision is there and to what extent we need to expand that, and to what extent we will need to change and move really quickly if there is no deal. That's something that I think we have to learn and we need to convince the FE sector about in terms of moving more quickly and to be more responsive to the demand that there is in the workplace."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Yes, because there is the dilemma you touched on earlier about providing the skills that are required for the economy and providing the courses that are easy to fill. That is a live discussion across FE and HE, but you're confident that that discussion is taking place in a constructive and positive way and moving in the right direction."}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Well, it's helped that we've put \u00a310 million on the table, because they do understand now that we are serious about our aim of ensuring that they do respond to what employers are asking for. So that has helped a lot in terms of focus and, of course, we're in the middle of a review now as well in terms of how we fund FE, and that will certainly be a part of that."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Okay, thanks."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Can I just go back\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Sorry, Chair, could I just clarify something? The last question you asked me about\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "I was just going to go back to that, yes."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "\u2014fees\u2014. Sorry. Of course, that is in the context of a 'no deal' scenario. There could be a scenario where there are reciprocal arrangements, so, if a deal was reached with the European Union that established the principle of reciprocal arrangements, then, obviously, the ability of the HE institutions to charge international fees would be curtailed. I just want to make that clear."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "If there's not that agreement\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "If there's no deal\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "\u2014then it will be open to universities to charge market-driven, international rates."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, that's right. Sorry, I just wanted to clarify. I should have made it very clear that the answer I gave was in the context of no deal, which is what we seem to be talking about mostly this morning, but if there was a deal to have reciprocal arrangements, then that ability, obviously, would be curtailed."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay, well, can I thank the Cabinet Secretary, the Minister and the officials for attending and for answering all our questions? We very much appreciate your time. As usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy after the meeting. Thank you very much. Okay. Item 5, then, is papers to note. Members will see that there are 18 papers to note, so I'd like to suggest that we note them as a block, please, and just to flag that I would like to return to paper to note 18 when we go into private. Is that okay with everyone? Everyone happy to note those? Thank you. Item 6, then, can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting and the whole of the meeting next week? Are Members content? Okay, thank you."}]}
