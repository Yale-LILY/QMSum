Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and {vocalsound} uh from the user interface person . Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process . {vocalsound} Okay , so {vocalsound} these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um {vocalsound} so basically uh the {disfmarker} as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um {vocalsound} and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um {vocalsound} okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the {vocalsound} the use for television , {vocalsound} in order to keep things simple . Um {vocalsound} also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it {disfmarker} so {vocalsound} it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . {vocalsound} Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um {vocalsound} there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so {vocalsound} I'll basic go over to the {disfmarker} Okay . {vocalsound} So {vocalsound} if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates {disfmarker} uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here . {vocalsound} So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , um which then {disfmarker} so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated {vocalsound} to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver . Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Um so {vocalsound} i in my personal preferences um {vocalsound} I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um {vocalsound} uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions . {vocalsound} That's about it . {vocalsound} So anything that you would like to know or {vocalsound} {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} Thanks ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} Br"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . 'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah .

No ? No ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Should {disfmarker} yeah just wait for a moment , adjusting ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Oh okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay , that's fine , that's good . Okay , let's start from the beginning . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some {vocalsound} some first issues that came up . Um 'kay , so the method I was um adopting at this point , it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um {vocalsound} all the project but it's just at th at this very moment ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um uh my method was um to look at um other {vocalsound} um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used . And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities . {vocalsound} And yeah , and then just to um {vocalsound} put the main function of the remote control in in words ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um so the findings uh were {vocalsound} um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm {vocalsound} uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . And and also the volume is very important . Um {vocalsound} um {vocalsound} I als"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh switching on off channel , uh volume , {vocalsound} okay , that's great ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "'Kay . Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm {vocalsound} functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then {vocalsound} there are {disfmarker} surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . Um then {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then {vocalsound} the channel numbers and then um {vocalsound} the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then um other functionalities um {vocalsound} could be just {disfmarker} uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um {vocalsound} done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So at the {disfmarker} for the time being that's uh that's all ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "If you have questions {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "If {disfmarker} I mean that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for {disfmarker} that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , and also it's it's um {disfmarker} other question is uh because there are so many different {disfmarker} And there are so many different things that could possibly be included"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{gap}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . Um but um {vocalsound} so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or {disfmarker} I mean in {disfmarker} we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um well , I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I mean um what other options would you have ? A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , and it'll make the costs {disfmarker} yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly , not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other mm proposals um ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and uh with um {disfmarker} because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . So yeah ? Cool ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm-hmm . Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Sure , we can discuss that maybe after the next one ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Cool . Do you wanna give me the little cable thing ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Do you want to {disfmarker} yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh am I going in the right direction ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound} Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} No . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wait ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Oh , I'm getting hungry . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay , here it comes .

Ah , that's why it won't meet . {vocalsound} Okay , cool ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "You set ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yep , cool . Okay , functional requirements ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Alright , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Hello ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{gap} try to press {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Is it plugged in prop"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "oh , okay ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "It's working ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "it's working ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "yep ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Cool , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Excellent ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . Um so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control .

What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . {vocalsound} Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Um current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide .

Individuals, owner-operators, and those who are earning $1 more than $1,000 are being told that they don't qualify for the emergency response benefits. Meanwhile, fraudsters are getting them.

On Friday, students in Quebec and Canada will be able to apply for the Canada emergency student benefit, which is a good thing. This program was necessary, particularly because the number of students who won't be able to get back their jobs from last year is much higher than the number of jobs that might be available to these young people. There are also issues of duration. We don't know how long these jobs will remain unavailable. People talked about a risk to being in the labour market and meeting the needs of the labour market. On April29, the Deputy Prime Minister made a formal commitment to ensure that these programs are accompanied by work incentives for youth and all CESB recipients. So that everyone knows what they're getting into, I'd like to know whether the employment incentives that will accompany the Canada emergency response benefit will be known by Friday."}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "I thank the hon. member for understanding the importance of supporting students who, for the most part, won't be able to get the summer jobs they were counting on.

That's why we're setting up programs, including Canada summer jobs, but also another program with 76,000new jobs for young people in important sectors, so that young people can also get jobs. We will continue to work with youth and employers to ensure that gaps in the labour market are addressed, while ensuring that youth are well-supported."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet", "content": "That's very interesting, but it doesn't answer my question at all. People in the fishing, tourism and agricultural sectors, as well as municipalities and, from the very beginning, of course, the Government of Quebec, more generally, have expressed fears that job gains will cause people to lose their benefits and discourage them from going to work. The only way to avoid that is to ensure that people keep more money as they work more. That is the principle. In fact, we propose that over the $1,000no-penalty limit, half of the earnings be exempt from penalty. Is this something that could be considered? Since it's been two weeks since the commitment was made and it's urgent, can we act now? The emergency shouldn't last eight months."}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Mr.Chair, young people need money, but they also need work experience. This is an unprecedented situation, which is why we're working with seasonal industries and the different regions to make sure they have a sufficient workforce in their situation. Students can be part of it, but at the same time we must provide the necessary support for those who can't find a job. That's why we continue to work with the industries involved to ensure that they have a sufficient workforce while we support students."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet", "content": "Unfortunately, the spirit of it doesn't seem to have been understood. I doubt that, even in the best-case scenario, the government will be able to get all the jobs needed in a timely manner for all these young people to decide to go ahead. So, first of all, there will be a shortage of jobs. Second, people aren't crazy. If they earn less by working than they earn by not working, all the good faith in the world won't solve the problem. Can we make sure that people keep more money in their pockets as they work more? I think we can have a clear answer, given the timeframe. People are going to start registering for the program on Friday. The principles are good, but a clear answer would be good too."}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Beginning Friday, students will be able to apply for the Canada emergency student benefit. When they apply, they'll all be directed to a job bank that we've set up to make sure they know what jobs are available to get not only the money they need, but also the experience they need for their future, while helping our society in this crisis.

Mr. Chair, one of the most devastating outcomes of this COVID-19 crisis has been the impact on seniors. Eighty per cent or more of the deaths during COVID-19 have been seniors living in long-term care homes. The military had to be called in. Out of 14 countries, Canada has been deemed the worst in its care of seniors. Despite all this, the Prime Minister has said recently that he doesn't feel it's the federal government's responsibility to find a solution. How can he say to families reeling with loss that it's not the federal government's responsibility to play a role in solving this problem?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Mr. Chair, perhaps the fact that the NDP no longer has many seats in Quebec has caused it to forget the importance of respecting the Constitution and the areas of jurisdiction of provincial versus federal governments. We will be there to work with the provinces as they deal with challenges in their long-term care facilities. We are there as a partner, but we, on this side of the House, will always respect the jurisdiction of the provinces and be there to support them in fulfilling those responsibilities."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Jagmeet Singh", "content": "Everyone across Canada has just heard this Prime Minister double down on the idea that he doesn't feel it's his responsibility, despite the fact that the Canadian military had to go into long-term care homes. There is a role that the federal government can play. Both Liberal and Conservative federal governments have been consistently, for decades, cutting transfers to health care. They can increase those transfers to ensure long-term care is adequately funded. We could also ensure that there's a national care guarantee, working with provinces to ensure that we are meeting the best standards. We could increase workers' pay. We could ensure that there's no more profiting off the backs of seniors when it comes to long-term care. Will the Prime Minister commit to some of these care guarantees?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "It will come as exactly no surprise to the vast majority of Canadians that the Liberal Party will always stand up for the Constitution of Canada. We respect the Constitution. We respect areas of provincial jurisdiction. As I have said from the very beginning of this crisis, we will be there to help the provinces as they manage the challenges they're facing. The federal government does have a role to play, and it is a role to support the provinces in doing the things they need to do during this unprecedented time. We will continue to be there."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Jagmeet Singh", "content": "I am glad to hear the Prime Minister is no longer trying to hide behind jurisdiction. We know that in long-term care homes, the for-profit long-term care homes have been the site of the worst conditions, where the greatest number of seniors have died. Will the Prime Minister join us in committing to remove profit from the long-term care system? Vulnerable seniors should not be subject to the profits of a company willing to cut services, staffing and quality of care instead of ensuring that seniors get the best care possible."}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "I think it has become clear for all Canadians that we need to improve the care offered to our seniors right across the country. We cannot look at these numbers we are seeing and these tragedies hitting so many families and not want to see us as a country do better. That is why we of course recognize that we will work with other orders of government, particularly the provinces in whose jurisdiction this area rests primarily, to support answering these questions for the long term on how we improve the way Canada supports our elders. This is something really important that we will be there for."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Jagmeet Singh", "content": "At the CHSLD Herron in Dorval, 31seniors died in one month. The residents were left without food, dehydrated and without care, and those with COVID-19 symptoms were not isolated from the others. Families pay between $3,000 and $10,000 a month for their loved ones to be at the centre. How can the Prime Minister think that he doesn't have a role to play in finding a solution to this devastating problem?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Mr.Chair, all Quebeckers and even all Canadians were stunned to learn of the tragedy at the Dorval CHSLD. We were very happy, as citizens, when the Government of Quebec reacted firmly and asked many questions in connection with this situation.

With respect to the Minister of National Revenue, I would point out that the member for RichmondArthabaska asked her a very clear question yesterday, which she was unable to answer. What does a person who has received the full CERB, $2,000, and returns to work this week have to do? Do they have to pay back the amount they aren't entitled to? Do they keep the$2,000? Do they have to wait and include it on their next year's tax return? Which of these three options should the person choose?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos", "content": "I thank the hon. member for his question, which is very relevant.

Since that time, the commitments from the government have reached very probably around $300billion, making those first $500 million pale by comparison.

I will tell him, though, that we fully respect the jurisdiction of provinces and territories to address the needs of their constituents and their members, and we work very closely with Quebec and with all provinces and territories to make sure that the funds we transfer from the federal government can be utilized in a way that best meets the needs of their constituents."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet", "content": "Let's not get into that. It says to me that French is the second official language. Well, it's my first official language and it's the first one in Quebec. I would like to have heard that in French. I would like to have heard it from the Prime Minister, because it's a constitutional issue. Basically, you could say that it's our heritage. So that is what I would like to have heard. Let me proceed with a short and simple question: is health in the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces in the current crisis management situation?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Pablo Rodriguez (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons)", "content": "Mr.Chair, I would like to tell my colleague that we have no first or second official language.

Patty Hajdu", "content": "Mr. Chair, we live in a federation where we work closely together with provinces and territories so that we can reach our mutually important goals, one of which is that all citizens of Canada, all members of Canada, have access to a public health care system that meets their needs.

Mr.Blanchet, you have 21seconds left."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet", "content": "The answer could be even shorter than the question. Is health in provincial jurisdiction? Will there be an increase in the health transfers and will they come without conditions?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "Mr. Chair, I am sure the member would argue that it is important to work together. The federal government transfers money to the provinces, as he is well aware, to deliver health care, which is within each province's and territory's jurisdiction."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We now move to Mrs.Gill."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Marilne Gill (Manicouagan, BQ)", "content": "Thank you, Mr.Chair. As the member for Manicouagan, I would like to address the House today on a matter that is very important in my constituency. At 350,000square kilometres, it borders the Gulf of St.Lawrence. Regionally, I am also in eastern Quebec, which includes the Gasp, the Magdalen Islands, and the Lower St.Lawrence. These are regions whose economy rests basically on two very important seasonal industries: tourism and fishing. Make no mistake, it is not the workers who are seasonal, it is the industry itself, as our former leader Gilles Duceppe so rightly used to say. Those industries are very important for that region of Quebec, but I see no measures to support them that accommodate all their uniqueness. These are cyclical industries, meaning that they operate at a very specific period during the year. A few minutes ago, I heard the Prime Minister say that he had intervened to help the companies and the workers in those seasonal industries. I would like to know what the specific assistance is and how it is tailored to the companies and the workers in the seasonal industries he mentions."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Navdeep Bains", "content": "Mr.Chair, I would like to thank my colleague for her question. We know that the current situation is causing upheaval in the lives of Canadians from one end of the country to the other and that it is having a major impact on our small and medium businesses. Since this crisis began, we have not hesitated to implement strong and speedy measures to support more Canadians. That is what we will continue to do. We know that the tourism sector is key to a number of communities in the country. We must help them to get through this crisis as best we can. We are continuing to have discussions and to tailor our measures so that as many Canadians as possible can take advantage of them."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Marilne Gill", "content": "Mr.Chair, with all respect, I am hearing that nothing has been done. Measures have been proposed, but, as I understand it, they are not specific to the seasonal sectors. Let us take the seasonal fishing industry. The fishers are currently going out, but right in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis. One fishing season has been pushed back. The same thing applies to tourism. The season will be pushed back, and it is possible that there may even not be one. The people and the companies in this sector have no second chances. They cannot start again in the fall. It's a bit like agriculture. They can't start a fishing season or a tourist season in the fall. So they need assistance. We have some proposals. For example, would the government be prepared to let the Canada emergency response benefit provide workers with eligibility to employment insurance benefits? They could then get through the coming year and make it to next season."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos", "content": "Mr.Chair, I want to thank the member for speaking about the situation in all regions of Canada, particularly in Quebec. From the start, we've been implementing significant measures to support the millions of workers who are currently struggling. We've taken significant measures with respect to tourism, agriculture and regional development. We're providing broader investments, such as the wage subsidy and emergency loans for small businesses, of which there are many in my colleague's constituency. We'll continue to work very hard so that the workers and businesses in her constituency can get through this crisis and emerge stronger and more united."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Marilne Gill", "content": "Mr.Chair, that's strike two. This is the second time that I've asked a question about targeted assistance for the seasonal industry. My honourable colleague's response doesn't make me feel any better. The workers in the industry also don't feel any better when they see that, at the end of the summer, they'll have no job and no money to put food on the table. Will these workers receive assistance adapted to their needs? It's the same thing for businesses. We're currently talking about the businesses in my constituency, but there are also businesses in the East.

The Prime Minister announced the business bailout, and in that proposal, he said that there would be limits on CEO bonuses and share buybacks. By saying limits, the Prime Minister is suggesting that there would be some amount of bonuses or share buybacks that could be paid for with public dollars. If that's the case, how much?"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "The honourable minister."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr. Chair, we believe that it's very important that we support jobs. In that regard, we're trying to make sure that businesses can get through this time. As we provide that support, we've been very clear for large enterprises that share buybacks will not be allowed, period, and that there will, of course, be limitations on total compensation for senior executives in order to give Canadians confidence that we're doing the things we need to do to support them, but that we're not supporting executives."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Jagmeet Singh", "content": "Mr. Chair, Germany has actually taken the lead and said that if a company wants public money, then its executives must commit to reducing their pay. Will Canada follow Germany to ensure that public dollars go to workers and not to enrich the executive suite, and commit that no public money will go to bonuses or increasing salaries for executives?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr. Chair, we are looking forward to releasing the complete details of the large employer emergency financing facility, and I think the member opposite will be quite pleased to see that we will be leading on behalf of Canada in advance of what Germany is doing."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Jagmeet Singh", "content": "Mr. Chair, we know the PBO has said that $25 billion, at least, is being lost to our revenues because corporations are avoiding paying their fair share. Will the Prime Minister commit today very clearly that if a company is hiding its money by putting it in an offshore tax haven, that company will not receive public help, yes or no?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr. Chair, again with regard to this program, we want to be very clear that the support that goes to large businesses actually supports their Canadian enterprises and their Canadian employees. In that regard, we will not allow any company that has been convicted of tax evasion to have access to these funds, and we will carefully evaluate on an ongoing basis to make sure that companies remain eligible for this support based on their continuing investment in Canada."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Mr. Singh."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Jagmeet Singh", "content": "Mr. Chair, how many companies can the Minister of Finance name that have been convicted of tax evasion that would be denied help under this program?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr. Chair, I think what's most important is that we focus on Canadians. We're trying to support Canadians, whether they're working for small or large businesses, so they can get through this, can support their families during this time, and come out with a job at the end of it. That is exactly where our focus lies in this regard."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Jagmeet Singh", "content": "Mr. Chair, not a single company. We are four years past the Panama papers and there hasn't been a single conviction. Those are simply fancy Liberal words saying that a company that has been convicted of tax evasion.... There are simply no companies that this government can give as an example. Why don't we follow what France has done and commit very clearly, not in Liberal fancy words but straight up, if a company is hiding its money by using offshore tax havens, it will not get public help. Will the minister commit to that right now?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr. Chair, we've been working with France and other countries to make these rules stricter for businesses. The process around the common reporting standard and the base erosion profit shifting has made it more difficult for firms to move money into tax havens, and it has ensured that we have transparency in seeing when they do so. We'll continue to do that hard work to make sure that businesses abide by the rules and pay their appropriate part of taxes in our country."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Jagmeet Singh", "content": "Mr. Chair, let's talk about hard work. If a company is not convicted of tax evasion, but is putting its money in Barbados or Bermuda, for example, specifically to avoid paying taxesand we have a similar example of Loblaws doing something like thiswill that company, despite not having a conviction, but clearly having avoided paying their fair share by putting their money in an offshore tax haven, receive help, yes or no?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr. Chair, I'd suggest that the member be very careful in accusing companies of wrongdoing. We have a country that respects international rules. We allow our companies to trade and do business around the world. That continues to be important, and that supports Canadian jobs. At the same time, we're trying to make sure those international rules work and get tighter. That's what we've been working on. We'll continue to do that because we know it's important that we can work internationally. It's important that companies pay their fair share here in Canada."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "The next question goes to Mr. Hoback."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Randy Hoback (Prince Albert, CPC)", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chair. The Liberals hand-picked ambassador to China, Dominic Barton, stated that China's conduct during the pandemic is damaging to its own soft power. However, when asked if there should be an investigation into China's behaviour during the crisis, the health minister stated that's not for her to say because she doesn't have all the evidence about what China did or didn't do. Why is Canada's ambassador to China criticizing China's actions during the pandemic while this Liberal government is defending it?"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "The honourable Deputy Prime Minister."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Chrystia Freeland (UniversityRosedale, Lib.)", "content": "Mr. Chair, Ambassador Barton is an excellent representative of Canada in China, and he is a member of our government and very much shares and helps to formulate our government's policy when it comes to China. Ambassador Barton, of course, shares our government's view that a post-crisis review is absolutely necessary."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Randy Hoback", "content": "Mr. Chair, the government's March 27 duty deferral announcement has caused tension within the trade community. Customs brokers are being asked to shoulder tremendous liability as importers are not required to make duty payments until the end of June, when there is a real possibility that some of them may find themselves insolvent. Will the government commit to a liability exemption for customs brokers whose clients are unable to pay the duties at the end of June?"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "The honourable minister."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr. Chair, we have worked hard to determine programs that we think can be supportive of individuals and businesses, including allowing for deferral of taxes through this period. That we believe is important with respect to the GST, which we've allowed to be deferred until July 1, and in terms of taxes for businesses, until the end of August. We think this helps businesses to get through this challenging time, and we'll continue to support businesses and individuals so we can have a strong economy when we get through this crisis."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Randy Hoback", "content": "Mr. Chair, the following three questions are from constituents in my riding, so hopefully, I'll get some good answers for them. The first one I'll talk about is Rick. He owns a small business, a local bowling alley, in Melfort. It's a family-owned operation, so he doesn't meet the payroll threshold for the wage subsidy benefit, nor does he qualify for any other announced loans or grants. There are businesses right across Canada that are in similar situations. Is the minister suggesting that they lie to get the funds, or will they make some changes so they qualify?"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "The honourable minister."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Navdeep Bains", "content": "I want to highlight some of the initiatives we have put forward to assist small businesses. The Canada emergency wage subsidy covers 75% of the wages of employees, and that way they can maintain their jobs. We've also put forward the enhanced work-sharing program. It's an option for businesses to pay their employees. On top of that, I want to highlight the Canada emergency business account, which has issued 590,000 loans. As the Minister of Finance recently mentioned, we've deferred GST and HST and customs duty payments for businesses for the next three months."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Randy Hoback", "content": "Mr. Chair, Robert owns a cleaning products company in Prince Albert. He tells me that Canadian custodians and building service contractors are not purchasing Canadian-made disinfectants because very few are included in the federal approval list for COVID-19, even though Canada produces many products that Health Canada has certified as disinfectants. Why is the Liberal government not prioritizing the approval of Canadian-made products?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "Mr. Chair, that assertion is not correct. In fact, we have been working very closely with producers of Canadian products as well as with our colleagues at Innovation, Science and Economic Development to make sure that Canadian companies have what they need to very quickly move through the approval process. Health Canada has accelerated this process, and most companies can get approved in one to seven days. Of course, there is an iterative process that requires companies to ensure that a product is safe for use in Canada."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Randy Hoback", "content": "Mr. Chair, last week the government announced $252 million in assistance for Canadian farmers, which was largely seen as an insult, especially given that a good amount of this money was already budgeted. A constituent of mine, Tracy, from Melfort, wrote to me asking me to advocate for farmers and ranchers so they can get the support they need to continue to produce our food. When will the government start to prioritize farmers and ranchers? Will they continue to reform the business risk management program?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau", "content": "Absolutely, Mr.Chair. We're working very hard with our provincial colleagues to improve the risk management programs.

If that is not the case, why is there such an obvious discrepancy?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau", "content": "Mr.Chair, those comments are completely unjustified. We're fully committed to our sectors, including the energy sector and the agriculture and agrifood sector. This is particularly important. These sectors are critical.

Jean-Yves Duclos", "content": "Mr. Chair, this is a very good question. I would love to have a lot of time to answer it. The answer is yes, of course.

It's a privilege to be here in the House today to represent the people of Rimouski-NeigetteTmiscouataLesBasques, but also to serve as the BlocQubcois tourism critic. Tourism in Quebec is a significant economic engine and wealth creator. This industry is vital to the regions of Quebec, as I'll demonstrate. The tourism industry in Quebec generates over $15billion in economic spinoffs and employs more than 400,000workers. In Quebec, one in tenjobs is connected to the tourism industry. Every dollar spent on tourism generates about 70cents in the Quebec economy. The tourism industry consists of over 30,000businesses, and two-thirds of these businesses are outside the major centres in the Quebec City and Montreal regions. In the tourism industry, 82% of businesses have fewer than 20employees. This shows once again the need to support this industry. I heard my honourable colleague on the other side of the House say that a plan was in place for the tourism industry. I want to hear what he has to say about this plan. To date, what specific measures has the government taken to support the tourism industry?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Navdeep Bains", "content": "Mr.Chair, I want to thank my colleague for his question. He's right. The situation is very difficult for all regions of our country and for Quebec. That's why we've invested in regional development. These investments will improve the situation in the tourism sector. These investments will provide assistance for festivals, programs and other initiatives. We'll continue to work with my colleague and the other members to find solutions that will improve the situation."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas", "content": "Mr.Chair, I'm not sure that I fully understood the plan. However, I can say that the people in the tourism industry don't understand the plan, because they're still waiting for it. One issue in the tourism industry involves fixed costs. Initially, we asked that part of the wage subsidy be set aside to cover fixed costs. The government implemented the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance. The assistance covers 75% of commercial rental payments under $50,000, and property owners pay the remaining 25%. To date, how many applications have been submitted under this program?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "The wage subsidy is very significant. However, we know that there are other fixed costs. That's why we've taken other measures, such as the measures related to credit and rent. We've combined several measures that will help companies bridge the gap until the end of the crisis."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas", "content": "We expect to hear a figure and not necessarily words. We could see that the program was ineffective, particularly for seasonal businesses, including businesses in the tourism industry. Businesses need to have suspended operations or to show a decline of at least 70% in operations since the start of the public health crisis. How can a tourism business that hasn't yet launched operations show a decline of 70%? It doesn't make sense. A recent survey conducted by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business shows that only one in ten businesses can benefit from this assistance. Yet these businesses need the assistance. Does the government believe that commercial rent assistance is effective even though only one in ten businesses can benefit from it?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Navdeep Bains", "content": "Mr.Chair, I know that the situation is very difficult. That's why we've introduced another option. Through the community futures development corporations and business development centres, we're providing $71million to businesses and organizations in rural communities by giving them much-needed access to capital. This investment will help many businesses in Quebec, particularly in the tourism sector."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "Mr.Blanchette-Joncas, you have one minute left."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas", "content": "Mr.Chair, in my humble opinion, one out of ten businesses amounts to 10%. This figure isn't very high and is far from a passing grade. What does the government plan to do? Does it plan to implement an expanded program to support businesses in the tourism and seasonal industries to ensure that fixed costs are more fully covered?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Navdeep Bains", "content": "Mr.Chair, we have a strategy. We've invested in regional development and in small and medium-sized businesses. We've helped the workers and we'll continue to work with the provincial governments to find solutions.

I'm sure that we can find solutions to help improve the situation for people in the tourism sector."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "We will now continue with Mr. Van Bynen."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Tony Van Bynen (NewmarketAurora, Lib.)", "content": "Mr. Chair, I would like to inform you that I will be splitting my time with the member for Kingston and the Islands. Mr. Chair, last week was Mental Health Week. We know that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a great deal of stress and uncertainty for all Canadians and that during this uncertain time, it is normal for many people to feel increased anxiety, depression and mental health issues. In fact, a poll by the Canadian Mental Health Association's Ontario branch showed that 61% of respondents were worried about the mental health of a loved one and more than half of the respondents were worried about their own mental health. In the Standing Committee on Health, we've also heard from many witnesses that our front-line heroes, working around the clock to protect us from the virus and to help others recover, are at great risk of physical and mental burnout. This shows how seriously Canadians need supports for their mental health and well-being during this most trying time. Can the Minister of Health tell my constituents what the government is doing to support Canadians during this uncertain time?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "Mr. Chair, I thank the member for NewmarketAurora for that very insightful question. In fact, we've been very worried about Canadians' mental health as resulting from the pandemic, but even prior to that we knew that we needed to create rapidly more tools for Canadians across the country, no matter where they lived. We've worked very closely with our provincial and territorial partners, for example, to amplify the work that they're doing through increased supports, financial supports. We also launched Wellness Together Canada, which is a digital portal, where all Canadians can get access to tools they can use to help with the circumstances they find themselves in and to get the information they need during COVID-19. It also allows Canadians to connect to paid professionals who can provide support in a variety of different ways, whether it's over the telephone, through email or by text, understanding that Canadians have different ways of connecting that work for them. We've also partnered with a number of organizations that provide supports to Canadians, many of the crisis hotlines, for example, that are working double-time or triple-time to try to keep up with the volume of demand. This is a difficult time for all Canadians and we will continue to work to ensure Canadians have the supports they need."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "We'll go to Mr. Gerretsen, from Kingston and the Islands."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Mark Gerretsen (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.)", "content": "Mr. Chair, students from across the country have been significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19. As we know, thousands of post-secondary students depend on employment throughout the summer in order to pay for expenses throughout their academic year. Unfortunately the pandemic has resulted in the closure of many businesses and organizations that would normally employ students who work during the summer. Thousands of students are now left without the financial means they were depending on to pay for their post-secondary educational expenses. In response to the concerns raised by students, the government announced the creation of the Canada emergency student benefit, which will provide students with the assistance they need to make it through these uncertain financial times. I represent a riding that has multiple post-secondary institutions, and my constituents have been asking when they should expect to apply for the Canada emergency student benefit. Can the President of the Treasury Board please give us an update on the status of the Canada emergency student benefit, and in particular, when students will be able to start accessing this benefit, and also confirm if and how it may be retroactive?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos", "content": "Mr. Chair, I would first like to thank the member for Kingston and the Islands for his strong advocacy in favour of young Canadians in his riding and across Canada. Mr. Chair, our government is committed to ensuring that young Canadians have the support that they need during this very difficult time. That's why we are investing $9 billion to support students and recent graduates affected by COVID-19. The measures include doubling the Canada student grants, raising the cap on student loans, creating new employment opportunities for students and launching the Canada emergency student benefit. I'm pleased to share with the House that the application period for the Canada emergency student benefit will commence on May 15. That is this Friday. This benefit will provide $1,250 a month to eligible students or $2,000 for students who have disabilities or dependants. Mr. Chair, when Canada emerges from this pandemic, we want to make sure that students are in a financial position to continue their studies so that they can pursue fruitful careers and help build a strong Canada."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "We'll wait a few seconds before moving on to the next five-minute period to allow the console operator to switch with someone else.

Victims of human trafficking continue to suffer during this crisis. Many are facing worse conditions and additional barriers to escaping human trafficking than before the pandemic.

Why would the government choose to do this at this vulnerable time?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Mr. Chair, human trafficking is, as we all know, one of the most heinous crimes imaginable. Our government is working to eliminate all instances of it. To combat human trafficking, we've launched a comprehensive national strategy that brings together federal efforts under one strategic framework. We have backed that new move with $75 million in additional investments, and the new strategy now strengthens Canada's ability to fight this abhorrent attack on human rights and human dignity."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Jag Sahota", "content": "Mr. Chair, this simply isn't good enough. The government is letting down our most vulnerable Canadians. We know that human trafficking hasn't stopped during this pandemic, and these front-line organizations have received the message that supporting them in fighting these heinous crimes is not a priority. What is the minister going to do to rectify this situation?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "As I said, we have developed a national strategy to combat human trafficking. We've made $75 million in additional investments, and this new strategy takes a whole-of-government approach. It empowers victims and survivors to regain their self-confidence and control over their lives, and it will prevent more of these crimes from taking place. It provides better protection and support for those most vulnerable to human trafficking, and it will ensure that police and prosecutors have the resources to prosecute these traffickers for their heinous crimes. Mr. Chair, we'll continue to work collaboratively with victims groups and to provide the supports that are required."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Jag Sahota", "content": "Mr. Chair, more vulnerable Canadians continue to be let down. There are effective medications that have been developed for those living with cystic fibrosis, yet this medication is not available here.

Patty Hajdu", "content": "Mr. Chair, there are two separate issues in that question, so I will talk about the PMPRB. As a government, we are committed, as you know, to increasing affordability of and accessibility to Canadian medications, to medications across Canada, and the PMPRB regulatory amendments will help Canadians to be able to afford their prescriptions.

We know the importance of lowering drug costs, but not at the cost of life-saving drugs not being available here in Canada. Waiting years for the government to reduce regulations is not an option.

In fact, the manufacturer of Trikafta has not submitted an application to market this product in Canada. However, that said, we do have a special access program for drugs that are not marketed in Canada. As of May 6, Health Canada approved 95 applications for 98 patients to access Trikafta through the special access program.

Her reality of living with CF has meant that she has had many visits to the hospital and had many health crises that have made singing impossible for a time.

On July 25, 2019, after the federal-provincial-territorial agriculture meeting, the agriculture minister promised big changes in 2020 for programs like AgriStability and AgriRecovery. Besides a pilot program in a couple of provinces and an application deadline, is there anything else you would like to report?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau", "content": "Yes, Mr.Chair. Since the July meeting in QuebecCity with the provincial and territorial ministers of agriculture, we've been working to improve the AgriStability program. This issue remains a priority, and it's included in my mandate letter. However, at this time, we're responding to emergencies that go beyond what the various risk management programs can provide to our producers."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Ben Lobb", "content": "You can appreciate, Minister, the issue we're dealing with here. The United States Department of Agriculture has allocated $19 billion to farmers, $16 billion of that in direct support. The program that was offered last week, $252 million, was a mere fraction of what the United States is getting. If the minister is telling farmers to bank on the existing business risk management program, it's not going to work. Countless numbers of pork farmers, just in my riding alone, have one thousand, two thousand, three thousand head of hogs ready to be shipped within the near future. They will lose $70 a head. AgriStability isn't going to cut it. We need an immediate program to help out these hard-working pork farmers."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau", "content": "I fully understand my colleague's comments. That's why we announced specific programs for the meat sector: $77.5million for processors, $50million for beef producers and $50million for pork producers. We've also increased, improved and facilitated access to AgriStability. One pork producer tried the calculator and told me that he could quickly receive $11 per head of hog. Alberta's agriculture minister even publicly stated that some producers could obtain the desired amount of $20 per head using the AgriStability program."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Ben Lobb", "content": "Mr. Chair, you can see the problem right there with the math. The minister just said that one of her pork producers is going to get $11. They are losing $70. There's a $59-per-head gap, times likely several thousand head of hogs in their barns. Let's go to another trying issue with agriculture. It's the carbon tax. I know that the government has their position on the carbon tax, and I know that I'm not going to change it, but I want to give the members of Parliament across the way, the government, an idea of what a pork farmer might go through. A pork farmer sent me their bill for February 26 to March 24. Their natural gas bill was about $2,400. In there was close to $500 in federal carbon tax. Farmers manage their woodlots ethically. They have environmental farm plans. They have nutrient management plans. They get no credit for any of the carbon sequestration and ethical environmental management on their farm, yet every month they are asked to pay a carbon tax. It just doesn't seem fair. I want the minister's opinion on that."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau", "content": "As you know, our pollution pricing policy is designed to build a clean economy. We've introduced exemptions for agriculture. On one hand, emissions from animal and vegetable production are not subject to carbon pricing, and on the other hand, farm fuels and other fuels delivered to off-farm points-of-sale are exempt. We've also provided partial reimbursements for propane and natural gas used in commercial greenhouses. We have already done a lot. We encourage producers to take advantage of the business risk management programs, and we are ready to do more. We've already shown that, and we will continue to do so."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "There is time for one short question and response. Go ahead, Mr. Lobb."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Ben Lobb", "content": "Mr. Chair, I know the Minister of Agriculture has toured my riding. She knows very well what the lay of the land is here. What about pork farmers? What about chicken farmers? What about hens? What about drying in the fall? All those farmers pay a carbon tax, and there is no program for them. They pay and they pay and they pay, and what makes it worse is that they are given no credit for the environmental work they do on their farms."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau", "content": "It's true that our producers work incredibly hard to protect the environment and ensure the well-being of their animals. That's important, to be sure, but I'd like to put the impact of pollution pricing into perspective. To put these estimates into context, AAFC used data from agricultural tax data programs to show the impact on a per-farm basis as a percentage of total operating costs. The estimates ranged from $210 to $819 per farm and 0.05% to 0.42% of total farm operating expenses."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "We now move on to Mr.Lehoux."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Richard Lehoux (Beauce, CPC)", "content": "Thank you, Mr.Chair.

Instead of staying cooped up in their homes, they are doing their best to retool and save the companies they work for. One of the only options they have is to work from home. Unfortunately, though, they don't have access to the tools they need. Cellular and Internet networks are inadequate, even non-existent in some cases. I want to know, not whether the government is going to help these Canadians join the 21st century, but when. Can you give us any assurances and, above all, a timetable for a real plan?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Navdeep Bains", "content": "I agree with the member. The situation is very serious.

Finding a solution is absolutely imperative."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Richard Lehoux", "content": "I don't think the minister understood my question. In the 2019 budget, the government promised to connect all Canadians to the Internet by 2030. This is 2020. That's 10years away. People don't need reliable Internet service 10years down the road. The pandemic has made the need even more acute right now. When, then, will people have Internet access? I'm simply asking you for a date now."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Navdeep Bains", "content": "Mr.Chair, under the last budget, we launched a $1.7-billion program to support broadband infrastructure. That's a lot of money for high-speed Internet. My fellow minister Ms.Monsef is in charge of the program. We also introduced the connect to innovate program, which has helped 900communities all over the country.

For example, I was talking to Ron, who operates an engineering firm in my riding that specializes in designing and building very expensive machines for their ever-expanding overseas markets. Business is down, but not by the requisite 30%. Of course not, since they're in high-growth mode, but just recently they had to lay off some very talented staff. Can the minister confirm that the wage subsidy program can be expanded or adapted to deal with high-growth companies that will play such a key role in Canada's economic relaunch?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Navdeep Bains", "content": "Mr. Chair, my honourable colleague is absolutely correct. We, the government, take enormous pride in our small businesses, particularly the start-ups and the high-growth firms. They're going to be absolutely essential for our economic recovery, and we know that some of them are ineligible for the wage subsidy. That is why we introduced a $250-million program in the industrial research assistance program through the National Research Council, strictly targeting and focusing on those high-growth firms that were ineligible for the wage subsidy, so that they can provide the wage support to keep those highly skilled individuals in Canada."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Tako Van Popta", "content": "Mr. Chair, there is another category of businesses that are falling through the cracks and feel they are being left behind by the wage subsidy program. Those are recently merged companies. For example, there is a trucking company in my riding that is significantly bigger this year than it was last year as a result of some key acquisitions and mergers late last year. All of the legacy companies by themselves would qualify individually for the wage subsidy, but the merged company does not. Can the minister confirm that the wage subsidy program is sufficiently flexible to accommodate recently merged companies?"}, {"speaker": "Hon.

He is identifying unique pain points that exist within the overall economy with specific examples of companies that are not able to access some of the programming we have provided.

The specific example that the member opposite raises is something that is under consideration."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Tako Van Popta", "content": "Mr. Chair, the government's commercial rent assistance program discriminates against certain tenants based solely on whether their landlord has a mortgage on the subject building.

Leslie is having a very hard time explaining to her tenants why some will qualify for the rental subsidy and some won't, depending on which building they are in. Can the government confirm that the nonsensical mortgage requirement in the rent subsidy program is gone?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr. Chair, the approach that was taken on trying to assist small businesses with rent is very much based on the fact that this is a provincial jurisdiction, so we have used the mortgage system as a way to do it. It is, in fact, not nonsensical. That said, we are looking at this particular issue. It's something that is under consideration.

Bill Blair", "content": "Our first priority is the protection and safety of Canadians. We've seen an unacceptable rise in gun violence right across our community. All weapons are being regulated in our country. Some, such as handguns, represent such a significant risk that we strongly restrict them. Some weapons, quite frankly, are completely unsuitable for any sporting or hunting activity, such as weapons designed for soldiers to engage in combat with other soldiers. We have now prohibited those weapons. The saving of lives is worth an investment in public safety. I want to assure the member we will bring forward legislation that will facilitate an appropriate buyback program. I look forward to a discussion in this House with the member opposite on how that can be done to ensure public safety and to ensure that we do it in as effective a way as possible."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "We'll now go to Mr. Manly."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Paul Manly", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to thank the government and ministers present for the rapid relief that they've provided to Canadians. I know the constituents in my riding really appreciate that.

The CERB requirements recognize dividend income for eligibility for the Canada emergency business account, CEBA, but the Canada emergency business account does not recognize dividends or contract payments. I've been contacted by many small business owners who have been legally paying themselves with dividends for years, but these companies cannot apply for the CEBA even though this might save them from bankruptcy during this crisis. Will the government make the necessary changes to allow dividend income to be admissible for CEBA eligibility?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Navdeep Bains", "content": "I'd like to thank the honourable colleague for his very thoughtful question and his advocacy in looking for different solutions and in working with us to help small businesses, not only in his riding but across the country as well. He's absolutely correct that the Canada emergency business account has been successful, as 590,000 loans have been issued. That's a reflection of some of the changes that we introduced, which made the criteria more generous so that more businesses could obtain assistance. He has raised the issue of dividends.

This includes environmental reporting. It includes wetland wildlife and bird monitoring, even though Canada is a signatory to the international migratory bird treaty. Water that escapes from storm ponds doesn't need to be tested. Air quality programs, including for first nations communities, have been reduced. Testing for leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, has been suspended. This is after the federal government has provided $750 million in funding for methane emission reductions. The federal government has also just committed $1.7 billion to clean up orphaned oil wells. That message, clearly, is about the negligence of the Alberta government. It is something corporations should be paying for. Will the federal government hold the Alberta government to account and withhold energy sector relief funding until these environmental regulations are reinstated?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Chrystia Freeland", "content": "Mr. Chair, I'd like to thank the member for his question and for his very collaborative approach with our government on a number of issues. I would like to thank him for this particular question and his particular reference to methane, because it gives me an opportunity to highlight some very important progress that the federal government made this week in working with the Province of Alberta. Just yesterday Alberta joined B.C. and Saskatchewan and published its own draft regulations on methane. This will allow us, in working with Alberta, to work on equivalency on methane, which will allow us to work towards standing down the federal system in those jurisdictions. This is tremendously important, because it will allow us to cut methane emissions by 45% by 2025. It's hugely important for fighting climate change together."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "Now we'll go to the honourable member for Hamilton Mountain, Mr. Duvall."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Scott Duvall (Hamilton Mountain, NDP)", "content": "Mr. Chair, I was pleased to hear about extending the tax deadline to October 1 in yesterday's announcement for seniors. After many discussions with the Minister of Seniors, I was glad to hear that she was listening to the NDP and many others on making this happen. It stops a lot of interruptions for people who couldn't get their taxes done. Mr. Chair, COVID-19 has been showing us in stark terms that Canadian seniors are struggling to make ends meet in Canada. Before enduring the crisis, it was clear that OAS and GIS benefits levels were just not enough for seniors to keep up with the cost of living, so we need to fix this now. Why is the government refusing to increase OAS and GIS benefits to lift seniors out of poverty on a permanent basis?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Deb Schulte (Minister of Seniors)", "content": "Mr. Chair, I want to thank my honourable colleague for giving me this opportunity to rise today and talk about how we are supporting Canadian seniors during this pandemic. Many Canadian seniors are facing significant health, economic and social challenges as a result of the pandemic. They built this country and now they need our help. Our government is taking significant action to provide Canadian seniors with greater financial security and give them the help they need during this crisis. We're building on past measures by introducing a one-time tax-free payment of $300 for those who receive OAS and of $200 for those receiving GIS, totalling $500 to seniors who receive both. We are also supporting community-based projects to improve the quality of life for seniors through the New Horizons for Seniors program, and investing in other charities. Seniors need our help, and we are delivering for them."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Scott Duvall", "content": "Mr. Chair, I was glad to hear that the Minister of Seniors is acknowledging the financial burden that our seniors are taking on. She mentioned the prescription dispensing fees, the added costs of their groceries and the delivery charges. I was glad that the Prime Minister acknowledged the heavy toll seniors are facing, and that they helped to shape this country and now they need our help. A surprising statement that I heard yesterday was the Treasury Board and the seniors minister's admission in their press briefing that the level of assistance being provided to Canadian seniors is quite low. Why is the seniors minister acknowledging all the burdens they're trying to help the seniors with, but the response they're giving is just a very low way of handling it?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Deb Schulte", "content": "I really do want to acknowledge my honourable colleague for his advocacy. I just want to assure him that while the government remains committed to implementing policies in our platform, we are focused on this health crisis right now. We have provided financial support to seniors sooner through the GST credit top-up, and now with additional payments to OAS and GIS recipients. This year we are investing over twice as much on financial assistance for seniors as we committed to in our platform, which is $3.8 billion compared to $1.56 billion in the platform. Seniors need our help and we're delivering. These payments have provided greater support for the most vulnerable seniors. Just to give some details, for those on OAS and GIS, they will get, in conjunction with the GST credit top-up, $875 per adult, and over $1,500 per couple. This is not an insignificant amount. This is a significant amount to support our seniors during this pandemic."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "You have about one minute left for both a question and a response. Go ahead, Mr. Duvall."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Scott Duvall", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chair. The minister was talking about there being a maximum payment, if it's possible. What I've heard from seniors is this is a one-shot deal and it's an insult to them. They want some stability on an ongoing basis. We did make an agreement about two weeks ago that help would be implemented without delay on the seniors issue and for people with disabilities. Why did yesterday's announcement include only the people who are seniors, but not people with disabilities? Why have they been omitted? When can they expect help to come?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Deb Schulte", "content": "I just want to touch on the two points raised. On the one-time payment, we know that seniors need help now, and that's why it's important to get that money into seniors' accounts as soon as possible. That is why we're providing the one payment right away, instead of small amounts spread over months. In the coming weeks we will look at additional supports for other vulnerable Canadians.

I'll be sharing my time with the member for Rimouski-NeigetteTmiscouataLesBasques. I have just one question. It's for the government, and this will be the fourth time I've asked today. When I go back home, what am I going to tell the people of Chandler, Amqui, Bic, Saint-Simon, Tadoussac and Harrington Harbour? Am I going to tell them that the government supports the Bloc Qubcois's proposal? We propose giving seasonal workers access to employment insurance benefits until next season, regardless of whether they received the CERB, how many hours they worked or how many they accumulated. Should I instead tell them that the Liberal government has nothing in store for them as they suffer through the crisis? The government hasn't managed to bridge the employment insurance gap, and is even planning to bring it to six, if not eight, months. That means they'll have nothing to put on the dinner table for the next year. I'd like an answer, Mr.Chair."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos", "content": "Mr.Chair, I have three things to say in response to the member's important question. First, we obviously understand what she's saying. The work is seasonal, not the workers. The work they do is fundamental so they can support their families and their communities in eastern Quebec and other regions. Second, the CERB delivers significant assistance to those often vulnerable workers, the majority of whom would be able or certainly eager to find another job. Third, and finally, before any longer-term investments are made, it's important to keep in mind that those who may have received employment insurance benefits but who lost them in recent weeks or who do seasonal work are eligible for the CERB. That said, we are also looking ahead. We've already announced some very important measuresand we'll continue to do soin support of tourism, culture, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and many other key contributors to regional development in Quebec and elsewhere."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "The member for Rimouski-NeigetteTmiscouataLesBasques, Mr.Blanchette-Joncas, has the floor."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas", "content": "Mr.Chair, the situation my fellow member just described is of little comfort to those in Quebec's regions. To be frank, the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance program is a flop. According to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, one in three businesses doesn't qualify for rent relief because it doesn't meet the 70% drop in revenues requirement. Half of businesses have indicated that their landlords won't be applying for the program because it's optional. Commercial landlords can choose to participate in the program or not. How is that going to help businesses, Mr.Chair? We are still trying to figure that out. Businesses, especially seasonal ones, need more support to cover their fixed costs. Will the government commit to reviewing the program, which is too restrictive for businesses and optional for landlords? The program must do more to help businesses, particularly seasonal ones, cover their fixed costs."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr.Chair, we know that businesses are, of course, very concerned about fixed costs. Our rent relief program is very significant. We haven't yet announced all the details, so it's much too soon to say that it's flawed. More information will be available in the next few days. At that point, we hope to be on the right track when it comes to fixed costs and rent."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas", "content": "I hope you're making adjustments. It's totally unacceptable that only 10% of businesses who need the relief can get it. What's more, the public health crisis has brought its share of change for businesses, particularly with the new health measures. They have to plan, implement preventative measures, have response plans, train staff and acquire the necessary equipment. In order to do those things, protect the public and reopen their doors, businesses have to assume the costs. Will the government commit to providing financial assistance to businesses, especially those in the tourism industry, so they can cover the costs of putting the new health measures in place?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Navdeep Bains", "content": "I know the situation is very serious in rural communities.

One of the terms for accessing the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance, CECRA, is that you must have a mortgage on the property. One of the key terms of eligibility for this support is that the landlord owes money to a bank. Will the Minister of Finance tell us if this program was designed for the benefit of landlords and tenants or for the benefit of banks?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr. Chair, I appreciate the question from the member opposite. I think that it's important to know that commercial rent and landlord-tenant relationships are provincial jurisdictions. Therefore, as we embarked on an approach that could enable landlords and tenants to get to an agreement that would help both, we used the CMHC as a vehicle from which we could do that. We think that we've come up with a program that provides advantages for the landlords and advantages for the tenants, and we will be announcing details that will include how mortgages can be put in place for those landlords who don't currently have them."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Greg McLean", "content": "Brookfield Properties, a large Canadian firm, announced that its rent collections on commercial properties for April were 15% of the lease terms. Luckily, Brookfield has another company, Brookfield Business Partners, poised to help by buying up the distressed equity of the firms that owe them money. Did the Minister of Finance design CECRA with this outcome in mind, washing out individual investors and small companies and transferring that value into the hands of vulture financiers who hold all the cards?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "In fact, Mr. Chair, we designed this program exactly with the idea in mind of the challenge that we're seeing. We're seeing that in many cases commercial tenants are not actually able to pay their rent, so landlords are not getting the rent that's due. Therefore, there's a mutual interest from tenants and from landlords in coming to an agreement. By providing funding through the mortgage system to those landlords, we recognize that we'll enable both of those two parts of the equation to come to an agreement that we think will be advantageous for the sector over the long term."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Greg McLean", "content": "In the past two months, the Bank of Canada has tripled the size of its balance sheet to almost $400 billion, with more to come, Mr. Chair. In the 2008 recession, the world's major economies endured quantitative easing on a previously unknown scale, most of which has not since been unwound. Canada endured a then-record $50-billion deficit, but we did not need to enter the uncertain world of QE, quantitative easing, as a result of the strength of Canada's oil and gas industry. Will the minister acknowledge that this government's oil and gas policy mismanagement has led to economic decline, necessitating hundreds of billions of dollars of quantitative easing?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Chrystia Freeland", "content": "Mr. Chair, let me challenge one assumption implicit in the honourable member's question, the assumption that our government fails to understand the importance of the oil and gas sector to our economy. Let me quote some leaders from Alberta and their response to the lease program. Tim McMillan, CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said, I think this is essential. Not all companies are going to need to tap into this sort of liquidity...but some that are normally high-quality, stable companies likely will be looking for this program to provide a certain amount of liquidity for them.

So this is me . Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort {disfmarker} like watching a hundred people {vocalsound} use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices . Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using a lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with . {vocalsound} And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their {disfmarker} the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room . So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . {vocalsound} Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are the standards . {vocalsound} So it's a good start for us ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} That's great .

That would include some {disfmarker} mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users .

Although the universities were under a significant degree of financial stress, they were able to secure funding for investing in their estates. Moreover, a structural change was also considered but the future plan was unclear. Besides, the government body tried to see a consistent minimum set of expectations of each university and would try to eliminate culture differences across divisions. When it comes to the risk, the government admitted that there would be more names in the high-risk category. Later, the meeting discussed a target at improving and increasing collaboration between HE and FE.

However, the investing was much restricted and it could not be a long-term solution towards the serious financial stress. To help with this process as well as monitoring the regulated approaches, the government received forecasts, around five-year forecasts which indicated that, for 2018-19, there would be a sector that was roughly in a break-even position, since the income was not increasing, which was the biggest problem. But luckily, they were not likely to lose any of the universities.", "relevant_text_span": [["11", "15"]]}, {"query": "What was the government's plan towards the structural change?", "answer": "Angela Burns AM shared with the findings from multiple representations from students and brought up the concerns of the consistency of funding.

The government was content with the fact that the governance machinery within the institutions was structured appropriately and if the universities would like to engage any other things than trivial borrowing, they need to get the government consent as well.

To tackle this issue, the government had provided funding in 2017-18 and 2018-19 to WISERD Education, which was a research collaboration between a number of the Welsh universities, specifically looking at educational issues.

Thank you, both, for attending this morning. We're looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first questions are from Angela Burns."}, {"speaker": "Angela Burns AM", "content": "Good morning. Thank you very much, indeed. I just wanted to talk about, really, the financial sustainability of the higher education sector because, as we know, there's been all sorts of things going on in the press. So, can I just start with, actually, quite a technical question and ask you what the financial indicators look like for the universities here in Wales, and are there particular indicators that are really flashing warning signals to you?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Well, shall I just start with a couple of contextualising comments and Bethan can come in then with some detail? It's undeniably the case there are financial challenges facing our universities. They result from three main causes: one is the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds, which is deeper and longer in Wales than it is elsewhere in the UK. There are increased pension costs and, actually, increased costs generally. And, of course, we also have current uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England, and whether that might play into Wales, and also Brexit. These challenges are not unique to Wales; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another. So, this is not a Welsh issue. Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales, there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales, and even now, that's still the case. So, Welsh higher education institutions are approximately \u00a340 million worse off than they would be in the English system. That's a challenge, and that is a result from a political decision to invest in students, and that's fine. The money's gone into the system but it hasn't gone into universities, necessarily. So, these are serious challenges for institutions to manage, but I think it is a managed situation. We're not seeing a crisis; we are seeing some real challenges, and there is a distinction, I think, between\u2014. We have to understand, though, that taking out cost to balance the books has a detrimental effect on the capacity. Obviously it impacts on the people who lose their jobs immediately, but there's a medium to longer term impact on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales. They are taking out capacity; they're not cutting at fat now, they're cutting out core capacity. And so, the range of the curriculum, the range of research and innovation, the range of the contribution that universities can make will be diminished by that. And against that backdrop, the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important\u2014delivery of that is going to be really important\u2014and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that. The Diamond money is coming in. This forthcoming year will be the first year we see an increase in the resource, through us, to higher education. And the projections in future years are better still, and that will be extremely important. The performance of the sector is very good; we had the national student survey results out yesterday. Wales is still the best in the UK, which is excellent. We have the best impact from research in Wales across the UK. So, all of that is very positive, but that is also being done at some cost. There are some very tired staff in universities, and we've seen some stuff in the press recently about some of the impact of stress there as well."}, {"speaker": "Angela Burns AM", "content": "Can I bring you back to the financial element of that? Can I just ask a question: what are the university reserves\u00a0looking like at present?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Here, I refer to my learned friend."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "The reserves are a measure. There's a difference between the distributable reserves\u2014I don't have those numbers before me, but looking at reserves, what is more important are those reserves that are available as cash or liquid cash. So, universities have reserves, but a large amount of that is tied up in their estates, so they're not immediately realisable. So, one of the key measures that we're looking at, which is even more important than surpluses and deficit, is the operating cash that our universities are generating at the moment. When we look at operating cash in 2017-18, they were generating, as a percentage of income, about 7.6 per cent, which contrasts with nearly 10 per cent for the same year for English institutions. And that represents their capacity to generate surplus cash to meet their costs, which now, increasingly, include the costs of servicing their borrowings. So, again, because capital funding has not been as available to universities as it was, they've invested in their estates and that's largely been funded by borrowings. The costs of those borrowings have to be met on an annual basis, so that's becoming an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities have."}, {"speaker": "Angela Burns AM", "content": "I just asked that question because I know that about four years ago, the universities were sitting on substantial reserves and were less than keen to deploy them back into actually using them for the students\u2014it was more about building up the war chest, if you like, of the universities. And I just really wanted to have an understanding of how that picture might have changed over the last four years and are they actually skinnier cats now, rather than before."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "We can get you that analysis, but even four years ago, I think the definition of exactly what's meant by reserves, it's really important to look at what are distributable reserves as opposed to the assets that universities have."}, {"speaker": "Angela Burns AM", "content": "Yes, I do understand the difference."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "And, there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates. So, for example, Cardiff University have had a bond rather than borrowing, which you draw down as you're spending. So, in the short term, the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances, but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and, over the next two or three years, will be utilised for that."}, {"speaker": "Angela Burns AM", "content": "So, overall, you're painting a picture of a sector that's under a significant degree of financial stress, and this is obviously using your key financial indicators. Do you monitor each and every university, or do you wait for them to come back and tell you what their situation is?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "We monitor, we receive forecasts, five-year forecasts, and we meet frequently with all our universities now. It varies, depending on the risks of the universities, as to how frequently we meet, but we're actually meeting with every university because even the forecast that we received last July, the changes, even in the 12-month period, are significant enough for us to need a better understanding of what the latest position is. The forecasts, if I just run through\u2014. We had a sector that, in 2017-18, had a deficit. Although it had a turnover and income of \u00a31.5 billion, which had increased, nonetheless it had a small deficit of 0.4 per cent of income in 2017-18, which was an improvement on the deficit the year before of 1.7 per cent, but notably, again, the sector in England were looking at surpluses of 3 per cent to 4 per cent in the same period. The forecasts that we had this time last year were indicating that, for 2018-19, we should have a sector that's roughly in a break-even position, but that has to be caveated with waiting for new forecasts in July, where there will have to be a reflection of the pension costs, and there have been significant changes in pension costs, both for the teachers' pension scheme\u00a0and the universities' superannuation scheme as well, and those will be significant costs\u00a0that universities have to build into their forecasts at a time when their income, certainly their fee income, is not increasing, and that is the challenge."}, {"speaker": "Angela Burns AM", "content": "Are we going to lose any universities in the next couple of years?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I don't think so. As I said earlier on, we're not seeing a crisis, we're seeing really challenging circumstances for institutions to manage. At the moment, our sense is they are managing them, so one of the things we try to do is to make sure that, insofar as we can see it, we are making sure that the institutions are alert to the challenges they're facing, and are actually engaging those challenges properly, and we are seeing that at the moment. So I think what we will see if the pressure continues unabated is more costs being taken out, so more jobs being lost, more capacity being lost, but that's not the same as falling over. I don't see people falling over. There is always the possibility of structural change within the sector, and that might be one of the solutions that institutions think about, but it's not a policy position, and it's not always a good short-term response to crisis anyway, actually. But I think, as I say, we're in a managed situation, but the challenges are quite acute. But I don't see an institution falling over in the foreseeable future."}, {"speaker": "Angela Burns AM", "content": "When you talk about structural change, are you referring to the fact that certain offshoots or divisions might close? I bring this up because I'm the Assembly Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, and I have had multiple representations from students, and their parents, who are about to go to Lampeter and who've been told that courses are being restructured, there's a massive staff loss, and they have concerns about whether the three-year commitment they're about to make to a course is going to be able to be sustained. So I am trying to drill down a little bit, because I think it's only fair for the students to know what they're up against, and also it's a bit like in the great depression\u2014you can start a run on something, can't you? Because if enough people believe it, then suddenly enough people will stop going to what is an excellent little university, really top-quality in medieval literature, in archaeology. And I'm just talking about one, but I know there are problems in other universities around Wales, so I just wondered if you could comment on that and also what processes you as HEFCW might have in place to protect any student who does find themselves in a situation where their course appears to be disappearing before their eyes."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "So, there's quite a lot in that question, actually. Let me try not to forget any of the elements. First of all, your comment about causing a run is a serious consideration. So, if we look at the debate that happened in the Senedd last week, from my reading of the transcript, it was actually quite a balanced debate where pretty much every contributor made reference to the contribution that higher education is making. There was reference to the national student survey scores, and in many ways Wales is the best place in the UK to come and be a student, because you are looked after properly in Wales. But there was also a perfectly legitimate exploration of whether or not there's a crisis, and if you look at the way in which that was represented in the media, the crisis bit stuck and the rest of it didn't. At the point where the sector is trying very hard to recruit students, it's really quite unhelpful that you get that sort of representation. So we do need to make sure, I think, all of us, that we try to avoid a situation where there can be media amplification of a problem that's not actually as acute as the media are portraying it, and that is very harsh. I'm not being critical of the political process here, but it has ripples and we do need to be careful that we don't start a run on this. In terms of the specifics at Lampeter, we understand that there are no plans to close any of the departments, and there certainly will not be plans to pull the rug out from under continuing students. That is just not what institutions do. So there's an absolute obligation on them to meet their commitments, and that's a contractual obligation anyway, so it's a legal obligation. But we also have a quality machinery that we operate where we would expect institutions to be able to demonstrate that they've put in place appropriate arrangements to ensure that students can finish their programmes of study. So they're not going to be recruiting students to programmes that they're not planning to continue\u2014they just are not going to do that. And if you think about it in a market context, it would be suicidal for a university to treat their students like that."}, {"speaker": "Angela Burns AM", "content": "But I have to ask these questions because the auditor was very clear that there was a material uncertainty in Trinity Saint David's financial plans."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Yes, I understand that, so let\u2019s come back to the material uncertainty. [Interruption.] No, I understand, and that's fine. What I'm hoping to try and express is that we have absolute confidence that the institutions will not do the dirty on their students. They will look after their students and if they're recruiting to programmes, they are recruiting to programmes that they are planning to run, and run through to completion. And the expectations that we place on them in terms of our quality assurance machinery is precisely that\u2014when they are engaged in portfolio change, they have to look after the interest of the students that they currently have. In terms of our oversight and monitoring, our primary consideration, again, is the interest of the students. They are the people who have, in many ways, least influence over what happens in terms of the way an institution is managed. Although, they do have a voice and, actually, the arrangements for the student voice in Wales are, again, better than elsewhere in the UK. But, nonetheless, we do not wish to see students becoming innocent victims of difficulties of management and financing. And so that is our primary consideration when we're looking at these institutions. Our institutional risk review process is fundamentally designed to make sure that institutions are grappling with their problems before they become a crisis. So, we have machinery, which has 70/80 different factors and hundreds of questions that we ask twice a year, to interrogate the performance of the institutions and to make sure that we are seeing them managing the issues that they're facing. So, it's not the challenges you face, it's the way you face your challenges\u2014it's a clich\u00e9\u2014and, at the moment, they are managing them, but if we were in any way concerned that they weren't, the people who are most at risk in that context are the students and we will be intervening to make sure that they were cited, and we do intervene when we have to."}, {"speaker": "Angela Burns AM", "content": "Well, following on from what you said, I've just got two really specific technical questions, then, to ask, because you said that you look across the whole scope to make sure that they are meeting all of their correct liquidity ratios and so on. So, considering how much is invested in their estates, are you happy that each university's estates strategy and its financing is prudent and has appropriate governing-body oversight in place?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Yes, so the estates strategies that institutions operate are overseen by either the full governing body or relevant sub-committees in respect of every institution, so there is proper governance oversight. And in all of those instances, there is staff and student engagement as well in the strategic approach on estates. So, the machinery is in place\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Angela Burns AM", "content": "Because it's the big thing that drives most of university borrowing, isn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Indeed, it is."}, {"speaker": "Angela Burns AM", "content": "So, if our universities are on a sticky wicket, we just need to know that the borrowing that they're undertaking is absolutely prudently assessed and is appropriate. So, as long as you're content, if I can hear you say that\u2014[Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Okay. We're content on two fronts: one is that the governance machinery within the institutions is structured appropriately to look at that, but also that if the institutions are wanting to engage in anything other than relatively trivial borrowing, they have to get our consent as well. And what we don't do is second-guess everything, but what we do do is make sure that the governing body, or its relevant committees, have been asking the right questions. So, there are two bits to this."}, {"speaker": "Angela Burns AM", "content": "And then\u2014sorry."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "Can I just add to that, then?"}, {"speaker": "Angela Burns AM", "content": "Yes, of course."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "In asking for the forecasts, we have reinforced this year the importance of universities looking at different scenarios. So, to be looking at the demographic and maybe in the past, where there's potentially been growth in the system and universities have built that into their forecast, we have explicitly asked this year that we are provided\u2014not just the governing body\u2014with the scenario where there is no growth in the income. That's not the core forecast, but a scenario, so that it's quite clear how reliant the forecasts are on that growth, and if that growth doesn't come through, what the contingency plans are for ensuring that all the cost commitments can be met. And we should probably just differentiate between\u2014we have a role before borrowings are entered into, but all the best forecasts in the world can never quite predict, certainly what's happened in the last two years, probably, in universities. So, there are significant borrowings that are now committed to and the key measures we are looking at are universities' capacity to meet their covenants and their repayments under those borrowings, because that's essential for maintaining their liquidity."}, {"speaker": "Angela Burns AM", "content": "Which actually, neatly, thank you, brings me to my last question, which is: have any universities broken those loan covenants or been close to breaking them, unable to pay their borrowings as and when they fall due?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "There was a significant change in accounting standards in 2015, financial reporting standard 102, so most universities had to renegotiate their covenants, but it was because the accounts were looking very different. The accounting standards brought about changes in how income was recognised and how some service concession arrangements, largely student accommodation arrangements, and pension costs, significantly, were recognised in the accounts. So, most universities have had to renegotiate covenants, but we're not aware of any who've had to renegotiate due to covenant breaches, other than one which the University of Wales Trinity Saint David disclosed in their financial statements\u2014that they did need to renegotiate their financing arrangements, which they have done earlier this year, and they have now negotiated new covenants. It's a core part of financial management in universities now that you manage your relationship with your lender as well as with us. Breaching covenants in themselves is different to doing that with your lender being unaware and the factors being within your control. So, again, from that perspective, we have the covenants built into our forecasts, we require the forecasts to show how the university are planning to be within their covenants. The nature of those covenants vary, but most of them require a measure of cash flow, a ratio between the cash generated and the cost of debt, so there is close monitoring that is required because of the borrowing in the system, as well as our ongoing monitoring as well."}, {"speaker": "Angela Burns AM", "content": "Thank you, Bethan."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Just before we move on to Hefin David, can I just ask you what your view, then, is on the statement included by auditors in the accounts of Trinity Saint David that there is material uncertainty?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "Yes, I'll pick up on that. The material uncertainty largely relates\u2014there is a note in the accounts that explains the factors that are being taken into account, but it largely relates to some significant cash receipts that have been subject to timing delays and the fact that the timing of these is essentially outside the control of the institution. The main delay relates to the receipt of funding for the Egin project, which was due to be received from the Swansea city deal. That funding has been delayed, but the sums due to the university are still due to the university\u2014it's the issue of the timing of those receipts that is causing a cash pressure. Receipt of that funding would certainly reduce the cash flow pressure at the university at the moment. Just in terms of cash flows, all universities have to ensure that they are maintaining enough cash in their system to meet their payments as they fall due. Most of their costs are incurred on a monthly basis, staff costs in particular, but the income flows into universities are now less regular. In days gone by, that funding would largely flow from us and that would also come on a monthly basis. The funding from the Student Loans Company now, for example, comes in chunks. A quarter of that money comes in in October, a quarter in February, and the majority of it, half of it, doesn't come into the university in cash until May. So, that's quite a different cash management scenario for universities to manage; it requires holding cash balances to do it."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Just before I bring Hefin in, we're going to need to have a bit of agility, as Dai Lloyd would call it, in our questioning and our answers if we're going to cover the ground that we need to cover. So, Hefin."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "How can we be assured that governance arrangements across the eight institutions are sufficiently rigorous but also consistent?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "So, the first point to make, of course, is that universities are autonomous, as you know\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I've just written 'independent and autonomous'."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Yes, all of that. And they are charities and so on, so they have expectations in respect of that in any case. The university governing body obviously is an important part of the machinery, particularly in terms of generating constructive challenge for the executive within universities. The governing bodies all are expected to behave in a way that is consistent with the guidance produced by the Committee of University Chairs, the CUC guide, which identifies good practice. So, it\u2019s a higher education code of governance and all Welsh universities work to that code. That code is itself up for review at the moment. So, that is an opportunity for that to be strengthened. Just in terms of governing bodies, it's also important that governing bodies engage in a process of continual refreshing, because that gives you a greater variety of perspectives, which is important. But it\u2019s also important they have people who understand the higher education business as well as from other contexts. Getting that mix right is important. As it happens at the moment, there are also issues about ethnicity and gender balance. Half the chairs of Welsh university governing bodies are female. Half the vice-chancellors are female. That\u2019s a positive position for Wales to be in. But I think our view would be that when you get an increase in the contextual pressures that we\u2019ve been discussing already this morning, the role of the governing body actually becomes even more significant. So, we have encouraged the sector, both the chairmen of the university councils, but also the vice-chancellors, to engage in a process of an independent review of governance in Wales. We\u2019ll be alongside that. We\u2019ll be supporting that. But, actually, it\u2019s important that they own it. And it hasn\u2019t been hard for us to encourage that\u2014they have been keen to take this opportunity to take stock. The Welsh higher education system is part of a UK system\u2014they don\u2019t want to be a million miles away from the rest of the UK in terms of expectations, but there is scope in Wales, given the scale of the sector, to actually construct something that is more challenging, I think, in terms of expectations, than might be the common denominator across the UK, and maybe some more exemplification. Importantly, in this exercise, we are not just interested in governance process. It\u2019s going to be quite hard to do this, but I\u2019m very keen that we engage\u2014and the sector are up for this\u2014in governance culture, because, actually, you can do process checks and you\u2019ll have the right structure of committees and have the right sort of papers going, but, in the end, it\u2019s the dynamic within that room and who\u2019s asking which questions and how well informed they are, and whether it's an open culture or is it a defensive culture\u2014these are really what influences the quality of decision making."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And how different are those cultures across institutions?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I think it\u2019s very hard to say. We don\u2019t sit in the governing bodies of those institutions. Very occasionally we get to observe one. Typically, that\u2019s at a point where there are sufficient difficulties going on that we feel that we need to\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Do you have the option to observe at any point?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "We can't insist, I don't think."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "We can ask to."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "We can ask. But in the main, actually, our presence would change the dynamic of that anyway, so I'm not sure that's necessarily helpful. But we are keen to see what we can achieve with the sector in addressing these issues of what constitutes constructive challenge."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I take from that that there might be different approaches in different institutions. Is your aim to see consistency in the same approaches, then?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I think we\u2019d like to see a consistent minimum set of expectations. I think there are differences, because there are people involved. In the end, it\u2019s about personalities, it\u2019s about people\u2019s background and it\u2019s about their knowledge. And we have a role to play in this as well, so we have a toolkit that we produce for governors, which, essentially, is a set of information that locates their university in the context of the UK, across a number of factors. So, if they had been told something that is not perhaps as true as it might be by the executive, they can see that in the data. Whether that toolkit needs a refresh\u2014I\u2019m sure it probably does, it\u2019s been there for a while now\u2014. So, part of that is what information we can provide to help governing bodies be properly informed as well."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Yes, and this is the independence and autonomy thing. This is quite distant from Government\u2014unlike other institutions, where you can prescribe some of these approaches."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Yes, and in the end I don't think there's any pushback from the sector in terms of wanting to operate in accordance with best practice."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Yes, and I totally defend independence and autonomy."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Absolutely. The challenge is all of us being clear what constitutes best practice."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, what about risk appetite? Do you feel that any governing bodies are exhibiting what might be considered to be an imprudent risk appetite?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I don't think so, and this manifests itself in two ways. So, we would see this coming through in forecasts, and we would see it coming through in requests for borrowings, predominantly. Actually, we'd see it in other ways as well. Our links into institutions are many and various, and we have our formal stuff, but we all have links into institutions that are informal and we\u2014. One of the beauties of the scale of the sector in Wales is we can see the institutions in a way that they can't hope to in England. It's just completely different. And so we would see it in other ways. But we have, in some instances, I think it's fair to say, helped institutions to think again about some of their aspirations. So, where we've seen things and we think, 'That just looks ridiculously optimistic,' we've just asked the questions. We don't say, 'No, you can't do that,' because they are autonomous, they make the decisions, but we try to make sure that they're asking the right questions."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, would you see that governing bodies are falling short in doing that themselves, in that, where they become strategic decisions that require due diligence, are the governing bodies themselves presenting that challenge? Or the fact you've just said that, does that suggest to us that, actually, they are falling short?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I think there's a mixture of things going on. We have a slightly different perspective and we have a perspective that is very intimately informed in terms of how the institution is performing. So, you have a governing body with a range of perspectives, and you will also have people who are very committed and very enthusiastic about the institution, and just occasionally it's helpful to get a slightly external perspective on these things. So, I don't think it's a shortfall as such, but I just think\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "The kind of honest broker role, kind of."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "The machinery depends on having a body like HEFCW doing some of that role, and the people who lend money to institutions are absolutely clear about that. So, we have relationships with the banks; they come and see us every now and again\u2014typically not to talk about individual clients but just to talk about what we do and how we do it. Interestingly, for example, when Michael Barber got up before Christmas and said there will be no bail-outs of universities, we had banks on the phone to us within a couple of days, wanting just to talk about how it is in Wales and is it still how it used to be. So, they are very keenly aware of what we do. So, it's not really a governance failure; it's just that the machinery includes us."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay, that's important. And one of the things, from a distance\u2014I mean, I've been involved in different ways in an institution, and looking at the institutions from a distance. There are people, as you say, involved, and people always make the difference in different cultures. Do you find that the relationships between executive teams and governors is effective, and are they sufficiently robust and challenging as well? Those executive permanent staff and the governors\u2014is there challenge there?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I would say, in the main, yes. Occasionally, we help the governors to ask the right questions, so occasionally that external perspective we've just discussed is helpful in that regard. Actually, there are times when there are tensions between the executive and governing bodies, inevitably\u2014that's not something that's remarkable\u2014and we can feel that as well. We have conversations with both governing bodies and executives."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And that can become apparent from a public point of view as well\u2014you know, media reports and\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Yes, sometimes these things can spill, and the governing bodies also include student representation, staff representation, who are typically union reps, and so, you know, there are all sorts of\u2014. I'm not in any way saying that people are indiscreet, but there are all sorts of interests that are sitting around that table that have to be managed within a governance context. So, sometimes it can spill. And these tensions are not all-out war, but there are sometimes differences of view and they have to be worked through, and that's governance working properly, I think."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay, which is\u2014some of the work you've suggested will help towards that."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And a last question: you've identified one university as high risk, five as medium, and two as low in the short to medium term. You're obviously not going to tell us which, but what I'm interested in is the direction of travel, and whether those that are 'medium'\u2014are they at any point at risk of becoming 'high' in the near future?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I think it's fair to say that the direction of travel is that we're seeing an increased risk profile in the sector in Wales, and it's about the financial pressures that we've already discussed this morning. And that is why the efforts that the Minister has gone to to secure the Diamond settlement, and, indeed, other bits of money now and again, are so important. So, she's doing what she can, and that's really good, but we always knew that, between the point of the Diamond recommendations being made and the full implementation, there was going to be a valley to cross. The new machinery costs more as you phase out the old as well. So, the amount of funding was always going to be under pressure; there's a demographic dip, and there are the other contextual factors we've discussed. We always knew there was going to be a valley. And the institutions have been working very hard to try not to take cost out now that they really don't have to take out, because they don't want to reduce capacity, which they'll struggle to recover again when the financial position improves. So, they are seeing deficits, which are managed deficits, where they're spending more than their income in order just to keep the capacity in. So, they're being as responsible as we could expect them to be in this."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And, if you're back in a year or two's time, the next few years, are we confident that there won't be more in the high-risk category? You said you don't see collapse, but are we confident there won't be more in the high-risk category?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Well, I think what I would always say about this process is that it doesn't guarantee 100 per cent accuracy. We can only go on what we can see. So, I wouldn't\u2014. HEFCW is innately cautious as an organisation, so I'm not going to say we're confident, but that doesn't mean to say we're worried either."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Right, okay. So, to answer my question: are we likely to see more in the high-risk category or not?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "We might."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "And, just to add, I think the key bit of that is maintaining the attractiveness of Welsh universities to students, because a large proportion are coming not from just Wales, but from England and internationally\u2014so, that's a key part\u2014and also that our research portfolio is invested in, and that also brings economic benefits. So, I think those are the two that we are [correction: need to be] able to maintain: the institutions as attractive options for students, and that our research capacity is invested in."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. I've got a supplementary from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Just in the interest of transparency, are you able to tell us which universities are in which categories of risk?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "We don't publish that; we publish numbers. So, that's, I'm afraid, where we're going to stick."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "They didn't even try to\u2014[Inaudible.] [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. The next questions then are from Janet Finch-Saunders."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Good morning. Can you explain your overall approach to the 2019-20 allocations and what your priority for allocations has been?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "We publish our funding allocations, and we published the 2019-20 allocations on 4 June. For 2019-20, we're allocating \u00a3149 million, and, as David said, this is the first year that we've been able to start putting funding, additional funding, in from the Diamond recommendations for investment in the sector. So, that means we've been able to increase our recurrent teaching funding by \u00a37 million\u2014not a significant amount, but it's a start. And we have maintained QR, which is our funding for research, quality research, and postgraduate research, at least at the same levels of \u00a376 million, as it's been that in previous years. We've increased part-time funding by \u00a31 million to \u00a326 million, and we've started to increase support for expensive subjects\u2014that's medicine, dentistry and conservatoire provision\u2014and higher cost subjects\u2014those are the sciences and the STEM. So, we made a start on that and increased that support by about \u00a36 million to \u00a320 million in total. And, in addition to that, we have strategic funding that we're maintaining for Reaching Wider projects and the S\u00ear Cymru project. And then, in addition to our recurrent funding, we have had strategic funding in our remit letters for the last two years. So, we're developing programmes for civic mission, community engagement, collaborations between higher education and further education, and, more recently, we had funding at the end of March to start to implement the recommendations of Graeme Reid's report for research investment, and also for developing mental health and well-being. That strategic funding is very welcome, but to be able to build those activities into our core funding, which we hope Diamond will bring, would be more sustainable for institutions."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. Now, the Minister talks of one skills system. How do your allocations to the 2019-20 academic year support and incentivise collaboration between HE and FE?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "So, there are probably two dimensions to this. First of all, we have provided \u00a33.5 million of separate funding specifically targeted to improve and increase collaboration between HE and FE. So, we put out a circular inviting proposals for that, and it was competitive, so we funded what was the best of the proposals, and we constrained it to be available only to pump-prime new activity or to add value to existing activity, but not just to keep things ticking over. We had seven bids submitted from across the three Welsh regions on a whole range of activities, which we probably haven't got time to go into now. I've got a long list here, but, for example, in south-east Wales, the University of South Wales is leading on a bid partnering with Cardiff University, Cardiff Met, with the Open University and all the FE players in the region. So, we were really pleased, actually. We tried to get it within regions, because that's how you get the biggest impact for learners in the area and also for smaller enterprises in terms of innovation work. So, that is a specific bit of funding designed to incentivise HE-FE\u00a0collaboration. And then we direct fund a couple of FE institutions for delivery of higher education for historical reasons, and we also have our funding going through to support franchise activity between HE and FE. There are about 5,000 students who are studying HE programmes under franchise in FE colleges in Wales, and our funding method has, historically for some time now, protected that money. So, we try to prevent universities from taking the money out of franchise and onto campus, because we think it's important to try to encourage local provision within particular localities. And, certainly in areas where public transport infrastructure is perhaps not what it might be, for people to move to universities can be quite a disincentive, so\u2014. But we encourage it that way as well."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. Then, finally from me, the council's remit letter for the 2019-20 academic year from the Minister does ask you to consider how you'd increase openness and transparency around the use of fee income. So, what are the issues here, and how will you take this forward?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "The reporting of the income and expenditure is largely provided, probably more so in narrative form in the accounts and the financial statements and annual reports of institutions. A number of institutions also provide graphs and more easily accessible information to understand the income and expenditure of universities. But we would accept that this information isn't easy to access at the moment. There are examples of good practice across the sector in presenting as simply as possible what the income sources are for universities and how they spend their money. And we're going to be working with the Welsh universities and sector bodies to improve the accessibility of that information for Welsh institutions. More transparent reporting of income and expenditure, and not just fee income, is actually very important for understanding how income cross-flows work in universities. Some reasonably simplistic analyses can assume that all the student fee just covers the direct costs of academic provision, but there's much more to the student experience than that, so there are costs: there are the infrastructure costs, the student support costs, even the community engagement and all the research activities bring benefits to the teaching and fee provision. So, more transparency of all the universities' income sources and expenditure and a better understanding of the income cross-flows and why you can't look at universities in isolation of student provision and research, you have to look at the whole\u2014so, we'll be working with them to improve that information."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. We're going to go to Hefin David now for some questions on part-time student funding."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Part-time student numbers are bucking the trend in Wales, as I understand it, and we are seeing a bigger increase in Wales of part-time numbers than elsewhere in the UK. How is that going to be sustainable within current arrangements?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "We've allocated \u00a326.5 million in 2019-20\u00a0to support part-time provision, and we have been able in 2019-20 to fund some growth. So, there is growth in that funding to allow those institutions and incentivise those institutions who have recruited more students than last year to continue to do so. That came at an overall additional cost of \u00a31.9 million, and, based on what we're hearing from student support, we're expecting to see that requirement increase. So, it's one of the areas where we'll need to look at how we prioritise Diamond funding. And at the moment, our intention\u2014but subject to knowing the quantum of it\u2014is to continue to support and fund growth in part-time provision."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, is it possible\u2014? With the Welsh Government's policy of developing lifelong learning, is it possible that will be ever spread more thinly?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "That is the challenge, and there's a piece of work that we have in our sights to look again at part-time and what it is and what the various drivers are. There's a temptation, I think, at times, to see it solely in terms of skills for an economy, and it is important for reskilling and upskilling, but actually, it's important for other things as well. If we see higher education solely in terms of skilling an economy, we've missed an important part of the contribution that higher education makes. But part-time is really quite difficult, because there's part-time that is about upskilling, part time that's about reskilling, there's part-time for social purposes, there's employer-supported part-time, there's student\u2014. So, there's a complexity there."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But they are more reactive to rises in fees."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Well, there is a sense that they are more price sensitive, yes, and so the support regime that the Government is putting in place is important, and that probably has made a difference to the numbers of part-timers entering the system this last year. But I think we need to stake stock of what is important about part-time, what the market will deliver, what the market won't deliver, what we should fund and so on. And there's a complexity around all that, as I've indicated, which we need to do a bit of work on with the sector, with the student body as well, just to take some stock of this over the next year or so."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Could we end up seeing significant fee increases for part-time students?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "My sense is we won't. The Government wishes us to monitor, so we monitor, and that in itself is not straightforward, actually. But your comment about price sensitivity, I think, is really the nub of it. There's a limit to how much a fee increase would be acceptable to the part-time market. So, I think it's kind of self-regulating in that respect. I don't think we'll see massive fee increases; we might see a bit, but we won't see masses, I don't think."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. We've got some questions now on funding for research and innovation, and also we'd like to talk a bit about a replacement for European Union funds. Si\u00e2n Gwenllian."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Thank you very much. If I could turn specifically to research, we know, of course, that both the Diamond and Reid reviews called for QR funding to be maintained in real terms, but the allocation is exactly the same for 2019-20 as it has been for the past nine years. Have you carried out any kind of assessment of the impact of this level of research funding on universities and, indeed, on the Welsh economy?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "I'm sorry; I missed the beginning of that because I couldn't hear this headset."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Si\u00e2n, could you repeat the question? Sorry. We had a bit of a problem with translation at the beginning."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes, no problem. I was talking about the Diamond and Reid reviews at the beginning of my question and the fact that they had recommended that QR funding should be maintained in real terms. But, of course, the sum hasn't actually increased over a period of nine years."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Okay. The reason the sum hasn't increased is because we haven't had enough money to be able to increase it and still meet the obligations we have to other bits of the HE system. We would dearly love to increase it. Both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid were very clear about the importance of being able to invest in our QR research funding, for a number of reasons. The capacity of the sector to be able to respond to funding opportunities elsewhere in the UK and across the rest of the world is itself determined by the size and the strength of the research base, which is sustained by QR funding. If they go for UK-based competitive research funding, that is typically constructed on the absolute assumption that QR will be part of that mix. So, they tend to fund to 80 per cent of the actual cost of the research, with the expectation that QR will plug the gap. And we know that, although the Welsh research base is extraordinarily productive, and really is punching above its weight in many ways\u2014and I mentioned earlier the impact of the research base in the last research excellence framework\u2014we know that, actually, it could do so much more, if it just had more scale. So, we fully endorse the reports from both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid that QR is important, and it's important also to be able to allow institutions to invest in research areas that emerge over time. It's almost impossible for a body like us, far less the Government, to know where these emerging strengths are going to come from, and QR provides the flexibility for institutions, which is absolutely fundamental to keeping the research base dynamic."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Therefore, you do have concerns that this isn't increasing\u2014you have that concern of a lack of increase in the level of investment. But has any particular assessment been made of the impact of not increasing that funding?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "So, there is\u2014. Graeme Reid's report produced an assessment of the correlation between QR funding and capacity to generate funding from other sources, and there's a very close correlation\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Has HEFCW done any assessment to look at the effect of underfunding research, to all intents and purposes?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Not directly. We've relied on the expert assessment of people like Graeme Reid. It's sometimes more effective to have external experts making these points than us or the sector."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Your remit requires you to encourage universities to continue to develop one particular element of research, which is educational research. How does your allocation for 2019-20 contribute to that in terms of pedagogy and educational research specifically?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Bethan, did you want to say something on this?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "I was just going to add that, when we look at the funding that comes into our sector in Wales, compared with the rest of the UK, it's easy to see from the figures that our percentage of income that comes from research is smaller than in England, so the figures show that we receive less of the money that's available, which is a factor that results from us having less QR as a percentage, so we're in a situation where we get less of that UK funding that's available as well."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "So, there's a knock-on to that; that's what you're trying to say. But from the point of view of my question on educational research\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "So, we have provided funding in 2017-18 and 2018-19 to WISERD Education, which is a research collaboration between a number of the Welsh universities, specifically looking at educational issues, and we're providing additional funding to that to add value to the Welsh Government's existing evaluation of the progress of pioneer schools in developing the three-to-15 curriculum in Wales. I won't go into the full detail of it now, but it's a five-partner project feeding into this with researchers from Cardiff, Cardiff Met, Trinity Saint David, Aber, Bangor and the University of South Wales. So, it's a collaborative effort, and we have, in the past, also funded WISERD Education, so it's an important research facility and increasingly being used, I'm delighted to say, by Welsh Government in underpinning its own policy thinking."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And likewise, in 2019-20, there will be allocations specifically for this."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "It's a bit early to say yet. We haven't allocated anything specifically in the main allocations that we've put out. There might be others to come, but we're not yet in a position to say."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. Well, could you provide the remit letter from\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014do that? You have to do everything in the remit letters."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "We do what we can to pay due regard to the remit letters, as the wording goes. So, we have it in our sights, but we're not yet ready to make announcements."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And then turning to the impact of the loss of funds were we to leave the European Union. Of course, this is going to have a far-reaching impact on future research, and the Reid review has made recommendations to mitigate this impact. So, what assessment have you made of how allocations will be able to help universities to transition away from EU funding?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "So, again, the Reid review has done a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of an impact assessment for us. And we endorse, just as the Government has endorsed, the recommendations from Reid. The Government has committed in principle to delivering Reid. The challenge is finding the money, and we fully understand that. There has been an additional \u00a36.6 million allocated for research very recently by the Government, which we have put out specifically in line with some of the recommendations from Reid. So, that's a start, but that's not sustainable funding, and it's not enough, really, but it is a good and welcome start. Reid was also not just talking about the money, but also talking about the way in which the Welsh research base both represents itself and also engages with UK-wide developments. And in response to that, we have recently issued our own vision for research and innovation, which was developed over a number of months, following the Reid report closely, working with stakeholders, including the Welsh Government, in order to try and set a vision for how we respond to the challenges facing research in the future, including the reduction, potentially, of access to EU funds. And a lot of that is\u2014. These Reid recommendations all come together; they're coherent. A lot of that requires investment in the Welsh research base in order to be able to go for competitive funding at a UK level. Since it seems possible at least, and possibly even likely, that any money retrieved from not having to invest in the EU will sit in London rather than necessarily being devolved to the devolved administrations\u2014we understand fully the Welsh Government's position on that, and we don't disagree with it. But either way, we need a research base that's able to compete, and that's why the investment recommendations of Reid are so important."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes. I think Reid was saying that there may be pots of money out there that aren't being accessed at the moment by Welsh universities. Are you able to help then within that process?"}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "One aspect that we do intend to fund\u2014and this is from Diamond, as well as Reid\u2014is to place funding back into the system for innovation. We're consulting currently, with the intention, if the funding is available to us, clearly, in the year 2020-21, to provide \u00a315 million back into the sector in innovation funding. That's funding that we had to take out when the new fee system came in. That is part of promoting the innovation, and part of the research portfolio as well."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Is that part of the UKRI funding? There is some \u00a37 billion in the hands of that organisation, as I understand it, and there may be some possibilities there too."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "That \u00a315 million will be money that comes from us, but the intention is that the money will go in in order to improve universities' ability to access that funding from UKRI. So, Innovate UK would be the part of UKRI\u2014and that we improve our ability to get funding from outside Wales. And, then, Graeme Reid says the same thing in terms of research\u2014that we need more funding to do the same thing there."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "And, then, there's also the recommendation from Reid that Wales needs to be better embedded in the conversations that are going on on a UK-wide basis, so the Welsh Government has established a presence in London in respect of research, and we have a colleague in HEFCW who is fractionally embedded in the United Kingdom Research and Innovation specifically to respond to that recommendation. And that is actually paying dividends; we are strengthening our relationship with the UK machinery, which is essential if we're to understand where they're heading and what their funding bids are all about, and even to be able to influence those."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, Si\u00e2n?"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "So, as far as research is concerned, it's not all doom and gloom."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Yes, I mean, you know, things are looking up. There is money coming in and if the Government, as it is able to, can find money and can invest in this area, then that will help."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Thank you very much."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Just a couple of questions from me, then, before you close: what is your recent work on the 'basket of goods' show regarding student accommodation costs? And have any institutions used their 2019-20 fee and access plans to make commitments to more affordable accommodation for under-represented groups?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "First of all, on the basket of goods, the work we're doing now\u2014we're currently in train in terms of analysing the data in respect of the basket of goods, so this is slightly premature, but our early look at the data indicates that there are no increases in costs, accommodation or other, that would cause us concern. So, it doesn't look like institutions are succumbing to the temptation to up their income streams from other costs. So, that's good. In terms of the fee and access plans, the sector has committed over \u00a328 million of investment in student support-related activities from the fee and access plans, and that includes, in many instances, bursaries that are designed to help students cope with the costs of accommodation and the cost of living more generally. The support is provided for a range of purposes, but a couple of examples, just very quickly: Trinity Saint David, since we've talked about them a lot today, they offer \u00a31,000 bursary to care leavers, which is in addition to local authority support for care leavers. Bangor also offer targeted support for care leavers, and these are often also extended, so they apply not just in term time, but throughout the holiday time as well, because people still need to live during the holidays. So, there is investment going in from the fee plans in that support."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. And just one final question from me then, going back to Trinity Saint David: are you concerned that the governing body of Trinity Saint David has taken decisions that have led to that material uncertainty, and is that unprecedented in Wales?"}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "My view is that the decisions that the governing body made were, in our view, perfectly rational decisions to have made, given the information they had at the time. So, what's happened is that a number of unforeseen events have arisen, which, actually, I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to have foreseen, and it's just a combination of these that has caused the cash pressure. So, I don't see this as a governance failure, and they are engaging with those challenges."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We've come to the end of our time, so can I thank you both for attending and for answering all our questions this morning? You did say that you would give the committee a note on reserves for the last four years, so we'd be grateful if we could receive that. And, as usual, you'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Thank you, again, for your time this morning."}, {"speaker": "Dr David Blaney", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Bethan Owen", "content": "Thank you very much."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Deputy Minister requesting further information for our scrutiny of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 2 is a letter from me to the Children's Commissioner for Wales also asking for further information to pursue our scrutiny of the Bill. And paper to note 3 is a letter to the Minister for Education asking for an update on the framework for young people educated other than at school. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to propose that we resolve to meet in private for the remainder of this meeting and for the whole meeting on 10 July. Are Members content?

After this, there were some questions and answers related to the reform and reconfiguration of the post-16 education sector, equality of opportunity and university mergers.

For example, in England, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, people still were not getting onto those courses. To solve this problem, they had taken several steps including making sure their ITE provision was world class, embarking on the first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise, etc. In this process, Llyr Gruffydd had a doubt that the level of ambition did not reflect the level of action that was needed actually.

Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies, although Dawn Bowden is running late. I'll take this opportunity to welcome Dawn formally to the committee but also to place on record our thanks to John Griffiths for his service to the committee. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is\u00a0a scrutiny session with a focus on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, Eluned Morgan, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning, and Huw Morris, who is the group director of skills, higher education and lifelong learning. Thank you all for your attendance this morning. If you're okay with it, we'll go straight into questions. The first questions are from Suzy Davies."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular, obviously there's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training. Obviously, this is at Welsh teacher training centres. Do you think there's still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places, or is there a trend where things are getting better?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Thank you, Suzy. I think, for this year's intake, although we're in touch with our providers, we're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year's intake for a couple of months. But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets. So, there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs. So, what we're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class, so that, actually, Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher. You'll be aware that we've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year. We have looked at financial incentives. It's not the whole answer, I think, to these issues, but it's part of a mixture of things that we need to do. You'll be aware that, for priority subjects, with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications, those financial incentives are now \u00a320,000 a year. We're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees, e-mailing them, sending them materials to ask them to consider (1) becoming a teacher, and (2) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales. We are now part of a full national programme of ITE\u00a0recruitment, giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher. So, there's a whole package of things we need to do. In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff, and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you for that answer. I can see there's a lot of activity, but what exactly is it responding to? Presumably, some research has been done about why people don't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers. I can't believe it's just about ITE, although this is very valuable, what you're talking about. Is there something that's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching isn't a profession they want\u00a0to go into? Is that something that's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No. I think what you will find is that this isn't a uniquely Welsh issue. I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border, which proves to me that money isn't necessarily the entire answer, because, despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses, they're not able to do that in England either. So, that proves to me\u2014what the research does show\u2014that it's not money alone that will get people onto these courses. Interestingly, I don't even think it's a UK problem. Recently, as you'll be aware via my written statement, I attended the Atlantic Rim\u00a0Collaboratory, which is a system-to-system conference. If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world, the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention. In the USA, they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers. So, in the Californian system, significant teacher shortages, and in Oregon, Washington. I met with New York state\u2014significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state, and in Finland, Australia. So, this is a common issue across the globe, really. That's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner\u2014it's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off. One of the things that we have got strong performance in, and I think this is perhaps something that we're trying to follow up on, are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status\u2014so, those are people who are training on the job. Those remain strong. There's high demand for those places, so much so that we've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year, which says to me that\u2014there's definitely a place for the traditional, 'Take a year off, do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'\u2014actually, that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching, which is why, of course, from next year, we will have our unique part-time PGCE\u00a0route into qualification. So, that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities, so they can earn while they learn, or maybe they've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course. I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools. So, there's no one thing, I think, that we can do that will solve this issue. But it is an international issue, I agree with that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Well, that's what I was after finding out, and, actually, what you've just said about the part-time PGCE\u00a0is pretty interesting as well, because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching, that's got to help, hasn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Can I just agree with you? I think that is really, really important\u2014that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce. I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really, really valuable. I was up in the Deeside\u00a0Sixth just last week, talking to the A-level chemistry teacher. She had been a teacher for a while, she'd gone into industry, worked in industry, and now had come back into teaching. She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue. I'm very keen to increase the diversity in our teaching workforce and I'm very keen in looking at career changers, who perhaps have different life experience and work experience, coming into our teaching profession."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you for that. Part of that diversity, of course\u2014it would be great if you had more people interested in qualifying to teach through the medium of Welsh. Great aspirations; the trend's going the other way. No-one can solve this in 280 characters, I get that, but can you give us some indication about why you think this is proving still such an unattractive option when it's clear that there's a policy for this country to improve the number of Welsh speakers? You'd have thought there'd be a pretty good carrot for this."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Sure. Again, data for recruitment for the 2018-19 cohort is not yet available and we are, as I said, keeping in touch with our ITE\u00a0centres to keep a close eye on them. I think an important thing to recognise is that there is a difference between the number of people who are on courses where there is a specific designation that enables them to teach through the medium of Welsh and those people who have linguistic ability and Welsh ability but don't necessarily do a course that allows them. So, there is a difference. We do think that, for the 2016-17 cohort, there were an additional 130 qualifiers\u00a0that, actually, were fluent in Welsh and who could have gone on to teach in Welsh-medium schools, didn't necessarily do a course that gave them that designation. But, clearly, we've got three academic years now to get to the targets that we've set ourselves. The evaluation of Welsh-medium provision in ITE reported at the end of last month, and the Minister and officials are busy working now to implement the recommendations of the report that was published, I think, on 28 September, to be able to move this agenda forward. Again, we've got new incentives, this year, both for people starting their course and then for teachers who complete their QTS after a year. So, we've added in new financial incentives this year to try and address some of those issues. But, clearly, these are ambitious targets and we will need to have a step change over the next three years if we're to meet them."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you for that, Cabinet Secretary. Thank you for that answer. We're now talking about cohorts of students coming into\u00a0PGCE and teaching degrees. If they're from Wales, they will have had Welsh as part of their education from day one, and we'll accept there are varying\u00a0qualities in different parts of Wales, different attitudes towards it as well. But there isn't a single a person now who's been through Welsh education who can say they have no Welsh at all, unless they've moved into the system\u00a0from, say, England very, very recently. What is being done within the teaching qualifications, including the degrees, to ensure that, at least in Welsh universities, those nascent Welsh language skills are at least kept alive, even though we're not talking necessarily about being at a level where people can teach through the medium? It's\u00a0the age-old question: once the school gate closes, is that the end of their Welsh use? So, is there something\u2014it won't be Donaldson, but in the teacher training qualifications\u2014that is keeping this going and, hopefully, increasing the usability of the Welsh skills they have?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, in terms of how we can encourage children who have got Welsh skills as a result of their education up to 16, how they can\u00a0continue to use those skills and, potentially, use them in the workplace, I'm sure Eluned will want to talk about\u00a0some of the work, for instance, in other, non-teaching sectors. But, with regard to ITE, you'll be aware that, in the evaluation report, as I said, that was published, the report comes forward with two options in how we could develop an intervention programme to support Welsh language\u00a0skills\u00a0amongst all primary and secondary ITE\u00a0entrants. So, what we'll be doing now as a result of that report is that we'll be working very closely with our ITE\u00a0centres\u00a0to develop and agree upon minimum provision that constitutes those skill levels within ITE\u00a0provision for all teachers."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Llyr."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "You have your targets for 2021, in terms of numbers of teachers coming through the system, which is positive, although, clearly, the report or the review itself said that, actually, we need to double the numbers, really. But it's not just the trends that are going down; it's a cataclysmic drop, really. We've lost 24 per cent in the number of people over the last four or five years who are going into teacher training to study subjects that they could teach through the medium of Welsh. So, it's a huge turnaround that we're looking for, and I'm not getting the feeling that the level of ambition and the answers that you're giving here this morning\u00a0reflect the level of action that's\u00a0needed, really."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, first of all, as I tried to illustrate to Suzy, the figures on their\u00a0own\u00a0tell one story, but there are additional people in the system with an ability to speak Welsh and to be able to use\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "I think it's\u00a040 per cent\u00a0of those who are currently in the system who don't\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "\u2014the language and skills. And if we look at qualifiers of ITE courses in Wales by degree type, actually, we see a different trend\u2014we see numbers going up. So, there are statistics and there are statistics. Depending on which ones you look at, it's quite a complex picture. And that's why we had the evaluation report. We understand and we know and acknowledge that there is more work to be done. That's why we have got the evaluation of provision in ITE\u00a0and that's why we'll be taking that ambition\u00a0forward. We know what we need to do. As I said, we're not sitting back and hoping\u00a0that something miraculous will change things. We are pulling levers and putting in place plans to improve that situation."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Thank you for that. Clearly, there are statistics\u00a0and there are statistics, so could you just explain to us which statistics you've used for your targets for growth over the next three years?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, that comes as a result of the work done for the 2050\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Upon which baseline are you basing the increases that you're projecting?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We're using the baseline of 2012-13. There has been a decline since then."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "That's the one I was using when I said '24 per cent reduction'."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "There has been a decline in those numbers. That's why, as I said, we're doing the work that we need to do to reverse that decline. In using those numbers, we also know that there are additional people in the system who are not captured in those figures and who do have the linguistic ability to use their language positively in school settings. So, what I'm saying is that that doesn't tell us the whole story, but I will be the first to admit that there is a significant job of work with our ITE providers to ensure that we will have the skilled professionals that we need to deliver on our ambitions, and I'm not hiding from that."}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Also, I just think it's worth saying that a lot of this is about building the confidence of those people who actually can speak Welsh, who are not teaching through the medium of Welsh, and to give them that support. First of all, we need to identify who these people are, so there is a job of work being undertaken now in terms of registration in particular\u2014when people register, let's just make sure that we collect that kind of data."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We don't even do that consistently at the moment. One of the recommendations of the report is that there is no consistent approach to understanding this baseline data and there's no consistent competency test that people start at the beginning of their course, so we need a national approach rather than leaving it to individual institutions."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Have we missed any tricks, potentially, in terms of the reforms to accrediting ITE, for example, in terms of, maybe, strengthening aspects around the Welsh language and provision in that respect?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No, I don't believe so. The accreditation process, which is independent of the Government\u2014the accreditation process demands of our ITE\u00a0providers that their provision will be able to meet the goals of our curriculum. Our curriculum is very clear about the equality of the language and the ability of our children, through all stages of their education journey, to be able to be bilingual children."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So, that requirement, as far you're concerned, is there."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Yes, okay. Diolch\u2014thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Before I turn to Hefin, can I just clarify\u2014?

What I would say is that from the very outset of our ITE\u00a0reforms we have made it very clear that I expect very high standards in our ITE\u00a0system, but the process is independent of this Government. I have confidence in the people who have been appointed by the EWC\u00a0to undertake that process, but it is independent of me, and it's not appropriate for me to comment on that further."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I fully understand that and the need for distance for the EWC, but there'll be an impact on students and staff. Students, first of all: are you concerned that the reduction in providers might have an impact on students, and those students going through the second year at USW? Would you have concerns about that issue?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "In terms of the overall numbers, we will be looking to commission from those institutions that have been accredited the number of training places that our planning tool says that we need. So, in terms of an overall number of places, we will commission from those accredited units. Clearly, there will be a responsibility upon the University of South Wales to ensure that those students already in the system are able to complete their studies and their course, with the appropriate level of support and tuition to enable them to achieve their career aspirations and to graduate from that programme."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And what about the uncertainty for staff, or would you say that's an issue for the university itself?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "These are autonomous bodies. They have to act accordingly, in compliance with any employment law or any statutory responsibilities that they would have as an employer. That's not a matter for me; that is a matter for the institution that is an autonomous body."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But I would be surprised if you weren't keeping an eye on this, given that it has been a key provider. Are you aware of when the appeal decision will be known?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "My understanding is that the appeals process is ongoing, and next month, perhaps. But as I said, this is a process that is independent of Government\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But it will have an impact for what you do."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "It will potentially change the nature of the people from whom we commission places, but as I said, I do not have any concerns that we will not be in a position to commission the appropriate number of training places that we will need as a result of our planning."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Suzy on this\u2014mindful of what the Minister said about it being an independent decision."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "It's not directly about USW; it's about the geographic spread of provision. I wonder if you could just give us a snapshot of what that looks like, and whether you think\u2014certainly for PGCE or postgrad courses, anyway\u2014that if they're not accessible geographically and we've got students who already have three years' worth of debt, they're not going to be looking to, necessarily, live away from home for a fourth year, and may want to study nearer home. Has there been any research done on the access to these postgrad\u00a0courses, about where people are coming from and whether that's had an impact on the fact that some of these places haven't been filled?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Currently, with our current providers, there is a significant geographical spread. There are centres here in the south-east, there are centres\u00a0in the south-west, in mid Wales, and in north Wales. Obviously, accessibility is an issue for us. We do think that, for some students, accessibility is an issue, and of course that's why we are responding with our part-time PGCE\u00a0route, which actually will be location neutral, because you will be able to study that as a distance learner, and so you will be able to remain in your community and undertake that course. So, that's part of the attractiveness, I believe, of offering that to people. So, if geographical disadvantage is stopping somebody from pursuing a career aspiration to qualify as a teacher, our new part-time PGCE, as I said, will allow them to do that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Thanks, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We're going to move on now to talk about reform and reconfiguration of the post-16 education sector. Janet Finch-Saunders."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. Good morning. There are some encouraging provisional signs regarding the demand for part-time undergraduate study for the first year of Diamond, but the \u00a312.5 million reduction\u00a0Higher Education Funding Council for Wales\u00a0is having to make this academic year has potentially placed the funding for part-time provision under pressure. Is there a danger that, without maintaining and growing this funding, Welsh Government will undermine the Diamond reforms and increase the cost of part-time courses?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Let's be absolutely clear what this Government has done for part-time students. We are unique, Janet: unique in the UK and, I believe, unique in Europe, in the parity of the support that is available for full-time and part-time students. So, Welsh part-timers have something that they do not get if they are in England or if they're in Scotland. It's too early to have definitive figures for the impact of Diamond on the number of people who are undertaking part-time study. I don't want to get into trouble by not having that verified data, and I know Members get testy with me for anecdotal evidence, but I can tell you this: there is one provider that is reporting at this moment a 40 per cent increase in the number of students that are registered to start part-time study with them this year, as compared to last year, and that reflects really, really well, compared to the onward downward trend that we see across the border for part-time. What this means, for us as a nation, is that people are able to take this opportunity to upskill themselves and to be able to develop their qualifications and to be able to move themselves up career ladders, and I think that's such an important economic factor for us. So, rather than feeling doom and gloom about the prospects for the part-time sector, the early indications, at least, show that the Diamond reforms are leading to an increase in demand and, more importantly, an increase in uptake\u2014students taking advantage of that system to go away and study."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. Is the Welsh Government able to reassure the committee that its ambitions for the post-compulsory education and training\u00a0reforms are still in line with the original Hazelkorn recommendations, and go beyond the Labour manifesto commitment of simply replacing HEFCW with a new funding body for HE and FE?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. So, you will be aware, Janet, that the agreement between myself and the First Minister that brought me into the Government and the Government's programme state very clearly about our desire to pursue the recommendations of the Hazelkorn report. I hope, by the end of this week, we will have published the responses to the technical consultation, and we will continue to move forward. And I would argue, certainly, that the reforms that we are intending to implement do go beyond just simply a body that replaces HEFCW and joins in FE. It's a much wider remit to the potential new commission. And, as I said, I believe we've had in the region of about 450 responses to the technical consultation and I'm pleased to say that there remains a consensus\u2014we will always have some arguments about the details\u2014but there remains a consensus on the direction of travel that we are pursuing. A summary of the consultation responses will be available to Members and will be published by the end of the week."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay. Is the Welsh Government still committed to introducing the PCET Bill before the end of the fifth Assembly, and are you confident this will happen?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I'm absolutely determined that we will get the PCET legislation on the floor. It's a substantial piece of work, as you've just alluded to. This goes just beyond abolishing a single body. So, it is a substantial piece of work, but I believe that we are on track to be able to do that by the end of this term. But it's a big piece of work."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Llyr, on this."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Can I just pick up on that? I mean, it is going to be a big job, and, clearly, there's a strong focus on creating the commission and putting the structures in place, but, of course, one of the drivers is that we want to effect a cultural change in the way that people perceive post-16 education. This thing about parity of esteem and all that kind of agenda. And a key part of this process, therefore, is the vision that people are waiting for. When are we going to see this coming forward? Because I think we're putting structures in place, so there's a big discussion about the technical stuff, but I feel there's a bit of a vacuum\u00a0in terms of the vision."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I would disagree with you, Llyr, because\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Right, okay. Well, maybe you should have come to the cross-party group on further education last night."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I would disagree with you because, of course, the technical consultation has followed what we had last year, which was a consultation on the vision, on what we needed to do to bring the sector together beyond just HE and FE, to the inclusion of sixth forms; work-based learning providers; apprenticeships; and bringing all of that together under one body. I believe that that gives us an opportunity to have better strategic planning; to help us prevent duplication; to help us bridge gaps that are not available for learners at the moment. It will, hopefully\u2014. My vision is that it will promote collaboration between institutions rather than simply having the market-based process that we see in other places where there's competition rather than collaboration. I want to see it strengthen links between schools, FE and HE, strengthen links between schools and employers and business, to make sure that we've got better information and advice services so that young people know what their pathways are and can make really informed choices about what's best for them, to help them make them. So, I think: we've done the vision, we're now doing the technical consultation, that will be published by the end of the week, and we'll move forward with our overarching vision that Hazelkorn elaborated and that we are now taking forward."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So, you would be very concerned if FE institutions were saying that we really need to see the vision, that that's the next step, that we really need to understand the vision."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "But, I've met\u2014. As I said, I was with one of our excellent FE leaders\u00a0just at the end of last week; it wasn't raised with me then. I do understand that there are concerns from the FE sector about will the vision be realised. I think there's a shared understanding of the vision, but I understand and I\u00a0do see some nervousness about, actually, in the end, will this just be HEFCW by another name, and, the opportunity for FE, will this be realised in this new body? We need to keep ensuring that, as we go forward and develop the policy, and as we develop, eventually, the legislation, that that parity of esteem and that true equality across all parts of the sector is realised."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you very much. Our next questions are from Michelle Brown."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Good morning, Cabinet Secretary; good morning, Minister. Your paper to the committee says that there's a need for more analysis and research into the outcomes for learners from different backgrounds. At the same time, Welsh universities have declared \u00a3104 million towards equality and opportunity activity for 2018. If you don't have the analysis, how can you be sure that the investment that's being made by the Welsh universities is actually going to have a positive outcome in the right places and lead to better outcomes for underrepresented groups?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. Well, of course, that would be one of the duties of the new commission set up as a result of our\u00a0post-compulsory education and training reforms that I would anticipate. The universities are required, under the\u00a0Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015, to produce fee and access statements, and the \u00a3104 million that they have to take off their fees to be able to promote this work\u2014those fee and access plans have to be signed off by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales as being robust and truly promoting equality of opportunity. They're also there to promote access and the opportunities for people to aspire to higher education. We are looking at\u2014.\u00a0It's quite early days, still, for that new regulatory regime to come through, so we ask HEFCW, when I meet with HEFCW, about the adequacy of those plans. Equity is an important part of my approach to higher education. That's why we're introducing the Diamond reforms\u2014so that those from the poorest backgrounds can be adequately financially supported and are not put off from going to a university. And we're also looking\u2014. I would envisage under PCET a better mechanism of tracking destinations for learners. So, for instance, in the FE sector, we're introducing new joint monitoring for outcomes for sixth-form learners and FE learners, because we've never tracked them in the same way. So, we're introducing that now so that we can see the destinations for those two sectors, but the PCET\u00a0reforms give us an opportunity to do that right across the board. Huw, is there anything else I need to add?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "Well, I'd just reinforce the point the Cabinet Secretary made about the fee and access plans being the vehicle through which\u00a0we get universities to specify what they're going to do, and the funding council tracks that. To make sure that we're doing that in a full and appropriate manner, periodically, we ask for that system to be reviewed. I think it was in 2017 that the\u00a0Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods\u2014the research arm of Cardiff University\u2014reviewed the system and looked at how widening access was being promoted by different institutions and whether that was working in all parts of Wales. The report from that group was considered by one of the sub-committees in HEFCW\u00a0and they are revising the process as a consequence. So, I think we can be confident that there are ambitious targets that are monitored, and, periodically, the system as a whole is reviewed."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Can you tell us what sort of research and data the universities are basing those access plans on? I assume they'll all have slightly different methods\u2014I appreciate that\u2014but can you give us any idea of how they actually formulate these access plans?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "So, there are data collected across the UK by a body called the Higher Education Statistics Agency. They produce detailed breakdowns, along with UCAS, of where applicants come from, which institutions did they study at, what courses, what their particular characteristics are, including their socioeconomic status, and that data is then analysed at a UK level and in Wales, through HEFCW\u00a0and its agents, to track what's happening at different institutions at different stages, not just in terms of who's applying and who gets access, but who progresses and what happens to people once they've graduated."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "So, there is already data there. I'm just wondering how that data that's already there differs from the research and analysis that you were talking about in your paper. They must be different, then. What specific analysis and research were you referring to in your paper?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We use the HESA\u2014. It is HESA, isn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "That's shorthand\u2014the HESA data, and institutions use that. We also then use WISERD and other organisations to supplement that piece of work. I think there is a challenge to some of this going forward. So, the Office for Students in England now is having some discussions about access to HESA data. This is a source of real concern to me, that Welsh institutions may not be able to have the ready access to that data because of changes the OfS may be making. So, we supplement where we think that there's value to be added in additional breakdowns, or in additional slicing of data and understanding of what is motivating people to come forward."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "And to give you a specific example of that as it applies in north Wales\u2014. So, take a university like Wrexham Glynd\u0175r University; they have quite a large intake of mature students. The data that's collected and analysed at a UK level tends to look at people who are going into university at a young age, not a mature profile. So, some of the analysis that we do in Wales\u2014indeed, the deliberations of the sub-committee that I spoke about earlier\u2014is about how do we make sure that those differences in Wales are reflected in the data and reflected in the targets that are set."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Okay."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. The next questions are from Hefin David."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Cabinet Secretary, are you in favour of more university mergers?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I wouldn't use the word 'agnostic', but what I'm in favour of is a healthy, strong and sustainable HE sector. If individual institutions wish to collaborate or, indeed, go further to a formal merger then, obviously, that is a matter for them. We're not pursuing or urging a policy of mergers, but, if individual institutions feel that is of benefit to them and their students, obviously, we would have an interest in that and making sure that they were robust plans, but that's a matter for individual institutions."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But HEFCW are pushing it."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, again, what HEFCW are interested in is a sustainable HE sector that is strong but, as I said, I do not have a burning desire or a set policy to try and pursue mergers."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. That's a little bit of a contrast with your predecessors, then."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, that's a matter for them."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. The reason I say it is because I was kind of on the inside when Cardiff Metropolitan University was under pressure from the then Minister to merge with the University of Glamorgan and Newport. It was a very difficult time for staff and, indeed, for students. You had the University and College Union and the Minister pushing it; the vice-chancellor of Cardiff Met at the time very much against it. So, do you think that it's really\u2014? You're agnostic, but do you think perhaps it's not worth the disruption that can occur to staff and students?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "As I said, Hefin, I have no formal policy for reconfiguration or mergers. That's not to say I don't believe in collaboration between institutions. Going back to the issue of ITE, a very interesting programme came forward from Cardiff Met and Cardiff University for their ITE provision. So, I'm all for universities and institutions working together, but there's no formal policy. These are autonomous institutions. If they see that there is an advantage\u2014I would hope for the student first, and, if we put the student at the front of this process, then we would obviously have an interest in that and making sure that that was the right thing to do. But, certainly, there is no pressure from us as a Government to pursue an agenda of mergers."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Just to be clear, then, that's likely to be a policy for the foreseeable future as well; you're not going to change that view."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I have no intentions at this stage, but 'Events, dear boy'. [Laughter.] You know, sometimes\u00a0there may be a situation that I cannot foresee at this moment that would necessitate, for the benefit of students, the benefit of Wales, a merger. So, never say never, but, at this point in time, I do not foresee us changing that policy."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Julie on this."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes, just looking back at that time, which I remember very vividly\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So do I."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I had many meetings with Cardiff Met. Do you feel there has been any disadvantage to Cardiff Met because that merger didn't go ahead?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I, personally, am not aware\u00a0of any disadvantage to Cardiff Met, but I would recognise\u2014I would absolutely\u00a0recognise\u2014for staff and students caught up in those deliberations and those issues, then that would have had a personal impact on them. In terms of the institution going forward, I'm not aware that they are currently struggling with any disadvantage from that discussion. And, as I said, I'm really heartened\u00a0by some of the really interesting collaborative work that Cardiff Met are interested\u00a0in doing, and new partnerships and new collaborations between institutions, whether that be Cardiff Uni\u00a0or local colleges, and I think that's to be welcomed."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "So, following on from what Hefin said, was it worth all the fuss?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, look, as it's turned out, we have a strong institution\u00a0in Cardiff Met, and I think, rather than looking at the past, we need to look at the future. But, of course, there was some reconfiguration and we need to understand any lessons that arose out of reconfiguration, and HEFCW are currently doing\u00a0some work, actually, to look at reconfiguration, the experience of\u00a0reconfiguration that did happen, and were benefits realised\u00a0and what are the lessons that can be learned from that process.

If I turn that on its head and have a look at University of South Wales, one of the concerns I'm getting from former colleagues and staff is that the Newport aspect\u2014because it was\u00a0a merger between Newport and the University of Glamorgan\u2014has been somewhat denuded by the merger, and the amount of activity in the new Newport campus and elsewhere in Newport has been reduced by the merger. Are you aware of those concerns that staff may have?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "As I\u00a0said, it's not for me to second-guess the judgment of previous Ministers who pursued\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But it's happening\u00a0now, I mean."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "\u2014a particular policy agenda. With regard to Newport, we are aware of concerns. Obviously, one campus closed completely, and there are concerns about the level of activity at the new campus. And we continue to discuss with the University of South Wales and the local FE college what offer is available to\u00a0the local population, but also the wider contribution that that institution can make to the rest of Wales, and we continue to have conversations with both\u00a0the college and the university about utilisation\u00a0of the facilities in Newport and opportunities that could be made available in Newport."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "That's interesting, because\u00a0that's the first time I've heard it confirmed from the Government that those concerns that have been raised by former staff and colleagues in Newport are actually echoed\u00a0by yourself, then."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, as I said, we're aware of them. We take our time to listen to people. When people raise issues with us, we take them seriously. Clearly, going back to the point that I believe Suzy made about geographical coverage, we want to make sure that FE and HE opportunities are available for people throughout Wales, and\u00a0we continue to work with providers\u00a0in that area to explore\u00a0what can be done to enhance the opportunities."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And, from a financial point of view, they had \u00a325 million for the merger. Are you satisfied that's value for money, and, at this point in the 10-year plan, that things are going as they should, with incomes being squeezed across the sector?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes. I mean, it's difficult, isn't it, to second-guess what would have happened, what might have happened, if the merger hadn't gone ahead, around the financial stability and sustainability of an institution. How do you prove that, if that hadn't happened, something worse or something better\u00a0might have happened? It's difficult to do that and to second-guess those judgments, but, as I've said, what I am interested in\u2014. And I can't change that decision that was made by a previous Minister\u2014it wasn't my decision\u2014but what I can do is to ensure that any lessons learnt, any evaluation of that particular set of circumstances, can be looked at and can help inform future policy, which is why HEFCW is doing the piece of work. When that's published, you and I will be in a better position to understand whether the aspirations of that particular merger were realised, not realised, and if we were in that situation again, could we do it better next time?"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay, so you'll reflect on that later. At this point in time, you don't have any concerns about the long-term sustainability of the University of South Wales."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No, not at this point."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Janet."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. The Welsh Government's draft outline budget for 2019 states that it will continue to provide \u00a320 million to further and higher education in 2019-20.

There is a process by which the Welsh Government's budget is dealt with, and those details will emerge later on this month."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "But can I just say on conditions\u2014? You will be aware that there are conditions attached to Government spend, both in the FE sector and in the HE sector.

We're\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Can I just pick up on funding, generally? Sorry. Because, we did talk about HEFCW\u00a0and part-time funding earlier, and I'm not sure that we addressed the issue of this \u00a312.5 million cut in a specific budget line from HEFCW, because what they've done, if I understand correctly, is that they've put four priorities into one budget line, which includes part-time teaching, and cut that budget line by \u00a312.5 million. Are you not concerned that that'll have an impact on part-time teaching, given that it's such a success story that you're proud of?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "HEFCW\u00a0have to take cognisance\u00a0of the remit letter, but then, ultimately, they are free to allocate resources as they see fit. What will drive part-time provision is the students taking it up, and universities responding to that desire and that need within their institutions. So, at this moment, I don't have any concerns."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We're going to move on now to look at the parity of esteem between academic and vocational post-16 education. The first question is from Michelle."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. Welsh Government wants to achieve parity of esteem between academic and vocational education, and I think that's a very laudable aim. Higher apprenticeships are a key part of this, but Estyn's recent inspection found that only four providers from 17 were achieving good outcomes for learners. What action do you propose to take about this, to make sure that those learners have much better outcomes across the board?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "First of all, just to make it clear that that is very much our intention. I think we have got work to do to make sure that we do reach that parity of esteem, but let's be clear that, in relation to these higher level apprenticeships, we were concerned that, actually, we weren't doing as well, perhaps, as we should be, which is why we commissioned Estyn to look at this specifically, and what it was that we were doing well, and what we needed to improve on. One of the things that we found is that we are doing very well in relation to foundation courses in terms of attainment\u2014we've got 83 per cent attainment levels\u2014but if you look at that at higher level apprenticeships, then we've got 77 per cent, so what is going wrong there? But, also, it's worth underlining the fact that, actually, we're still miles ahead of England, who are only reaching levels of about 61 per cent. So, we're already doing much better than England, but we're ambitious, and we want to make sure that if we are serious about this parity of esteem, how do we get there if we're not offering the kind of quality that we'd like to see in those higher level apprenticeships? So, some of the recommendations in that report, we'll be taking up. We want to increase the number of new employers\u00a0and mentors within the system. I think we're also very keen to make sure that people don't repeat learning that they've already done. That's a danger and it takes up too much time. So, there are lots of these recommendations that now we'll set in motion, and I think the important thing for us then is to understand that, in relation to who's doing well and who's not doing well in the FE sector, the bulk of where that finance goes is actually doing quite well. It's pushing some of the private sector providers where we need to actually make sure that the quality is where we want it to be, and is, very importantly, matching the needs of employers. So, we've constantly got to be looking at the courses: are they responding to the needs of the market and what employers are looking for? And that means revising the offer sometimes in terms of the courses."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Where are the difficulties arising\u2014? You refer to difficulties arising with the private providers. What are those difficulties?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Well, some of it is about, perhaps, not giving the kind of guidance that we'd like them to give in-house. So, they're perhaps not doing the kind of on-the-job work that we'd like them to do. So, I think it's making sure that, when they're in the workplace, they are still being pushed to attain those levels. But I think it's clear that what we need to do is to also listen to what the advisory board that we've set up in relation to apprenticeships is also asking us, and we've got the Confederation of British Industry advising us on that as well."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Do you have a service level agreement with the private providers?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Yes. I mean, the whole thing is under a tender procedure, obviously, and we will be revising that soon. There'll be a new apprenticeship procurement process that we'll be undergoing and starting to look at that process next year. So, there's an opportunity there for us to drive change in the system."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Would you be willing to share the targets under the SLA with the committee?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Well, I think the\u2014. I can't see that there'd be a problem with that, so I'm sure we could do that, but I think the way to make people move, quite often, is through making sure that you put the finances where they need to be, and then they're likely to shift. And, so, I think, in responding to this Estyn report, we can then build that into the next framework."}, {"speaker": "Michelle Brown AM", "content": "Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Julie."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes, thank you. Right, I wanted to ask about the investment. If we're going to get parity of esteem, we've got to, probably, get more investment in. Could you say why there isn't more investment in degree, and there doesn't seem to be any investment in Master's-level apprenticeships at universities?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Well, I think we've got to be careful that what happens is that the state doesn't pick up what, currently, people are prepared to pay for themselves, and, so, we've got to just make sure that that balance is right. So, what's happened in England, for example, is lots of people who were previously sitting Master of business administration courses, for example, are now switching into apprenticeship programmes. So, the system\u2014it means that, previously, they were prepared to pay and now the state is paying or the employer's playing it in a slightly different way. So, I think we've got to just be aware about how\u2014making sure that we don't get employers passing that responsibility that, actually, they have to upskill and to uptrain\u00a0their workers and pass it back on to the state, whereas, actually, they need to step up as well as employers."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "So, how are you going to judge that? How are you going to tell when, maybe, you should start putting some money in?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Well, what we are doing is we're putting money into areas where we know there are skills shortages. So, we're focusing where we want those apprenticeships\u2014and particularly at the higher level\u2014to be. So, for example, we're looking at ICT; we're looking at construction. There are\u00a0areas where we definitely need to be focusing our attention. So, that's where we'll be prioritising our funding, and that's what we're doing already."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And that's for degree-level apprenticeships, not Master's. Just degree-level apprenticeships."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Right, thank you. And then, in terms of getting data, could you clarify the progress on developing outcome and destination data for higher apprenticeships? Your plan seems to suggest that\u00a0data won't be available until 2020-21, at the end of the programme."}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "And that's because we're only just starting on this, and it takes a long time for people to complete an apprenticeship. So, we won't have anybody going from the higher level apprenticeship into a destination until around 2021, so there's no point in measuring that until that point."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Right. And then, can you tell us when you'll publish Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol's new operational plan to develop post-16 Welsh-medium provision, which was presented during July, and clarify if the plan requires additional funding?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "So, there is a report that was published in July, and we are waiting for the operational actions from that report to be published, probably within the next month. In terms of the implementation of that programme, some of that journey has already begun, so they're not waiting for the report to\u2014. We're not waiting for the actions to be very clearly set out; actually, some of that work has been done. For example, already, there's been a review of the governance. We're also looking at the kind of research that needs to be done in that area. I think what's clear, and something that's very much driving me as the Welsh language Minister, is this understanding that you reach 16 and you get this fall off a cliff in terms of the number of people who actually speak and use Welsh. So, that's the thing that we need to address, and that's why moving now into that area of further education is crucial. And the report, written by Delyth Evans, did suggest that we do need to move into this area but, actually, there wasn't necessarily a need for further funding in that area. But it may be something that we will consider, but it's something that we'll try and absorb, perhaps, from within the department."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "A relatively modest amount of money was being made available this year to be able to kick-start some of this work, but we are mindful of the recommendations from the Evans report. So, future allocations will have to reflect the priorities within the implementation plan, and that's not just money that goes directly to y\u00a0coleg, but also trying to get better alignment between other budget lines that support the Welsh language, and making sure that all budget lines that could help on this agenda are aligned to the recommendations and the implementation report."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Suzy, on this."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you. Just on\u00a0coleg cenedlaethol's extended remit, have you had\u2014? I haven't read the Evans report, but is there anything in there about the role of increased use of Welsh in adult community learning, for example? That's a further education pot, isn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Yes, it is, and we are very much in touch with adult community learning, and they are aware of the responsibilities they have in relation to the Welsh language. The issue, of course, with adult education, is that they have undergone some quite dramatic cuts."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Oh, yes, I don't mean the higher education sector that's taken over responsibility for this; I'm talking about community learning, low level, just having Welsh there. And, you know, as you mentioned yourself, post 16, people stop using it, so getting it in wherever you can as part of a strategy."}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Yes. They're aware of that responsibility and we\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "They're free to choose partners, then, are they, to help them deliver that?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "And also to work with the new organisation that we've set up to promote the learning of Welsh, in particular, that is based in Carmarthen. So, that's something also that's being driven, and they're working closely, I think, on this."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Oh, great, thanks."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "There's lots of innovative practice. So, for instance, up in Wrexham, if a student has gone into the college to do A-levels, then they may decide to do those A-levels through the medium of English. But if they were previously in a Welsh-medium school, they are actively encouraged\u2014indeed, persuaded\u2014to do their Welsh baccalaureate through the medium of Welsh. So, they may be doing their A-levels in English, but if they've come from a Welsh-medium school, the college proactively seeks them out and makes sure that there is provision for them to do their Welsh bac qualification through the medium of Welsh, or, for instance, they are working very hard to form tutor groups. So, the tutor group\u2014you might be doing your qualifications in English, but your tutor group will be a Welsh-medium tutor group, so that you are placed\u00a0with other students who have come from Welsh-medium schools, and your tutor does all that tutor work through the medium of Welsh. So, there are other ways in which we can continue to help support children's linguistic ability, even if they have made a decision not to formally study their A-levels, for instance, or a course, through the medium of Welsh, and we're constantly looking at new ways. I think one particular aspect of the market\u2014if we call it that word\u2014that we're interested in are those students who've been to Welsh-medium schools, but at 16, perhaps, as I say, decide to go to a college. So, for instance, here in Cardiff, looking at childcare, and the opportunity\u2014you know, there's a sector where we know we need a Welsh-medium workforce."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, definitely."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "So, again, it's trying to target those children, and track them from a previous Welsh-medium education into a college, capturing their language skills, and finding ways in which they can use them. Merthyr college\u2014there's a Welsh-medium champion in Merthyr college actively looking for children who have come from a Welsh-medium background, and they are allocated roles as Welsh-medium champions within the college, to promote. So, there are lots of innovative ways, especially in the FE sector, that they're looking to keep children's linguistic skills relevant, and they're using them, even if they make that decision to switch the language of their tuition."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, that's encouraging to hear. My question was about community learning, where it's essentially older people who perhaps are coming back to education in a way that wasn't as formal as it was before, if I can put it like that\u2014so we don't lose sight of them as well. I've still got an abiding worry that there's a cohort in the middle here of people who we might lose, and maybe pass on bad attitudes towards the Welsh language to their children, despite the fact that those children now have huge opportunities to absorb Welsh language skills and make the most of them."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. The next questions are from Llyr."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. I'd like to ask about the regional skills partnership\u2014partnerships, I should say\u2014because they are having a direct influence now on courses and provision in FE, and with degree apprenticeships in universities as well. You, I believe, received the Graystone review back in March, so could you tell us a bit about what was in it, and what the recommendations are?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "So, some of the recommendations\u2014. So, we wanted to review it because it's still relatively new. They've only been up and running about two or three years. He brought out some positives\u2014things that we, I think, are doing well. I think they found that the voluntary partnership approach was quite effective. He did suggest that, actually, what they need to be producing is much shorter, sharper, focused reports. There was a suggestion of a lack of transparency, in terms of reporting from those regional skills partnerships, and that's obviously something now that we've undertaken to review. And there, I think, is an understanding that what we need to do now is to put in place those changes. But, on the whole, what we've done is to reinforce our commitment to the regional skills partnerships, and in particular now, through allocating \u00a310 million to further education colleges to respond directly to the wishes and the desires of the regional skills partnerships, you can see actually the status of the regional skills partnerships has just grown significantly. Because now there is an outcome as a result of their recommendations. So, you've seen quite a dramatic shift, I think, in the respect for regional skills partnerships over the past year."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So, are there any recommendations in terms of governance as well\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "\u2014because, clearly, there may have been concerns about the way that people ended up being members of the partnerships? You touched on transparency\u2014clearly, that's an issue as well. So, just particularly on governance\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "So, on governance, I think there was an understanding that that needs to be looked at again, and that we need to get the right people around the table. And what is interesting is, I think, because it was a voluntary approach, because now people can see an outcome, we're getting different people now really showing an interest in being a part of the regional skills partnerships. So, governance is something again we're going to be addressing and following up the recommendations on in that Graystone review. Is there anything to add to that?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "Well, I was just going to say, I don't see why we couldn't share the review with you."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "That was going to be my next question."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "That might be helpful. And we are actioning the recommendations from that review."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "The normal course of action would be, of course, to have published it and then to publish a Government response. Any reason why that wasn't done? I find it quite strange that you're saying that you're actually actioning the report and you still haven't published it. As a committee, we've not been party to any of that, really."}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "I don't see why that can't be done. There's nothing to hide here, so why wouldn't we? We're the people who commissioned the report\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "I'm the one asking the questions. [Laughter.] No, but you're right. I just find it strange. I just find it odd that that hasn't been published."}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Okay. Well, we'll certainly get a copy of that to you."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Yes, okay."}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "May I just\u00a0say: we ask a number of people periodically to comment on what we do, and agencies we work with do the same. The status of those reports varies. I don't suppose we'd anticipated there would be the interest in this issue that there is and so, as the Minister said, there's no problem that I can see with that."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "And do you have a timeline in terms of by when you want to introduce some of the reforms that you're looking at now, because of this report?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Some of them have already been introduced, so we're not waiting. The transparency issue that I think there was a bit of concern about\u2014that's already been introduced. So, it's just about making sure that people understand what is going on in these regional skills partnerships. I think that's really important\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Well, quite, given the influence that they have\u00a0now. Yes, sure. Just another short one on the regional skills partnerships, really: how effective are they in supporting the planning and delivery of Welsh-medium provision in post-16?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "I think there's more we can do in relation to that. But I think there are aspects where we're already changing in respect of specific\u00a0sectors. So, if you think about the care sector, for example, what we do need is more people\u00a0who have those skills to speak through the medium of Welsh in the\u00a0care sector. And, coming back to the point that was made earlier, what we're doing now is looking at the curriculum: to what extent can we include\u2014? You don't have to do your whole course through the medium of Welsh, but there are aspects that would be very useful. So, those kind of things are being taken on board now in terms of the courses. One of the things that the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol are looking at is building the resources that will be needed in order to mainstream those into, in particular, those\u00a0front-line service areas where we have a skills shortage."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Okay. Diolch."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Cabinet Secretary, you know that\u00a0this committee has taken a very keen interest in the emotional and mental health of our young people. In the summer, the English universities Minister made an announcement about the development of a new mental health charter. That followed some concerns about young people\u00a0dying by suicide across the UK. Is Welsh Government expecting Welsh universities to sign up to that charter or are you planning to work on your own?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Thank you for raising this. I think it's really important that whilst for many, many, many young people moving away from home and starting their degree course is an incredibly exciting time and something they look forward to hugely, it can bring significant stresses with it, especially for first-year students, who, as I said, are moving away, perhaps are suddenly responsible for finances in a way they've never been responsible for, for all the day-to-day living that perhaps they've relied on other people to assist them with. So, it can be quite a stressful time. So, it is right that we look at how we can support health and well-being for students, especially mental health and mental resilience. So, I very much welcome the work on the mental health\u00a0charter, and HEFCW\u00a0are engaged and keeping a very close eye on what's going on to see the opportunities for Welsh universities to participate in that. But this was on a recent agenda item that I had with HEFCW, and indeed with the\u00a0vice-chancellors, when I met them last week, or the week before last. So, they are developing their own strategic approach to well-being and health for students, which will be underpinned by a co-created action plan with the universities themselves on supporting students\u00a0with mental health problems in particular. So, the strategic approach and the\u00a0action plan are being developed by HEFCW\u00a0at the moment and HEFCW\u00a0are also meeting with colleagues from England and Scotland to see the opportunities for a universal approach across the UK to supporting students. The universities, when I met with them recently, all shared a commitment to do better in this particular area. One, because it's the right thing to do, but, actually,\u00a0stopping people from dropping out and not completing their courses obviously is of a financial benefit\u00a0to the institution. So, it's actually the right thing to do for their students, they want to do it for that reason, but, actually, there is a strong financial underpinning to ensure that students complete their studies. So, it's looking at, again, each university looking at individual approaches of how better they can do that. But it's not just responding to students who become unwell, it's\u00a0actually, 'What can we do to in the campus to maintain\u00a0good mental health?' So, rather than just trying to fix a problem once it's occurred, it's 'What can we do?' And you'll be aware of individual institutions\u00a0taking different approaches. It's not something that we dictate, but individual institutions\u2014when they do exams, how work is assessed and marked and graded\u2014are taking different steps to promote well-being, as well as then responding to situations where students become unwell. We do know that financial pressures can be a source of huge stress for students, so we are constantly working with the Student Loans Company to make sure that the services that they offer to people are as good as they can be, and that there are no unnecessary delays that, perhaps, put a student under pressure or give students worries about their financial situation. And I would argue our Diamond reforms, which allow students\u00a0access to a living wage\u2014for some students, completely by a grant, for some students, a combination of grant and loan, with no expectation at\u00a0all that your parents\u00a0will contribute, which is not the case in\u00a0other places where there is an expectation of parental contribution\u2014that actually, hopefully, addresses some of those financial worries that some students may have. But I am aware that if people are waiting for their grant or people are waiting\u00a0for their payments, that can be a source of stress. So, ensuring that we have good performance by the Student Loans Company is crucial."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. And I'm sure the committee's very interested to hear the update on that. Are you able to give us any indication of timescale\u00a0by which you'd expect HEFCW\u00a0and the individual universities to actually have this work in place?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I'm not sure, but I will write to the committee and let you know. In fact, we can probably provide, from Universities Wales and from the work that's going on centrally, a list of\u00a0proposals that are being undertaken."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you very much. The next question is from Dawn Bowden."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. I wanted to ask you about the pay dispute, and I know that you're not the employer, because\u00a0I know that's going to be the first answer\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "You're right, that is the first answer. [Laughter.] Well anticipated."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "But we are in a stalemate here and you clearly have an interest in making sure that this dispute is resolved quickly\u00a0in the interest of the students and the reputation of the colleges et cetera, et\u00a0cetera. I can see how this dispute has arisen. When we've seen the teachers' pay settlement, we've seen FE settlements in England and Scotland higher than what's\u00a0on the table here. And I am concerned, and I do think this is where the Welsh Government does have a role, because\u00a0I am concerned that the employers seem to be using the funding issue as the reason not to have a reasonable settlement with staff. So, they've walked away from the table, they've said, 'One per cent, take it or leave it. Unless Welsh Government gives us any more money, that's the end of that.' And I'm really concerned about that, because\u00a0this is potentially going to have a major impact on whether we can recruit\u00a0and retain staff in FE colleges. And I look at the college in my constituency, Merthyr\u00a0college\u2014it's a tertiary college, they're providing A-level education across Merthyr\u00a0and they're astounding results they've been getting as well. I'm coming round to the question in a moment. It's really: what more do you think you can do as a Government to try to get these parties back round the table and not allow the dispute to become a political football?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Thanks very much for that. I think, first of all, you're absolutely right\u2014this is about ColegauCymru's negotiation, but we are keeping a close eye on the situation. I think it's probably worth emphasising that the reason this has come about, or part of the reason, is because\u00a0you've seen that pay settlement in relation to teachers' pay and we've had the consequential. So, sixth-form teachers are happy. The people actually providing the same teaching course in a different institution, you can understand why they may say, 'Something needs to change here.' The problem here is that it's about that, actually, that falls to the Welsh Government. We don't have that. Or at least it falls to FE colleges to fund that,\u00a0and it's up to them to come up with that proposal. We are keeping a close eye on things. I think it's fair to say that we'll wait until they get further along down the line, but we are extremely aware of the sensitivities of the situation."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you for that, Minister. When you say you're keeping a close eye on it, have you actually had conversations with ColegauCymru? Because I note what you just said there:\u00a0'We'll keep an eye on it and wait and see what's happening.' Well, all the unions are currently consulting. One has already balloted for industrial action. We could have the other unions also balloting for industrial action. I mean, this isn't something we want in the FE sector, clearly, so is there anything more proactive that Government could actually be doing to try to bring a resolution to this dispute?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Well, we are listening and speaking to ColegauCymru, and also we're aware of what the unions are saying as well. So, I think that's probably as far as we can go at this point. When they come to a conclusion, and when they come to us and say, 'Look, this is the consequence and this will finish'\u2014at this point, we have no idea where that settlement is likely to fall."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you.\u00a0Llyr."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Yes, thank you. Yes, we wouldn't expect you to make an announcement on this, because it's happening outside of Government, but there is a principle here, isn't there, in terms of pay equality between schoolteachers and FE? So, would you not wish to see a situation where we do have greater equality in that respect?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "In relation to teaching, I think it's fair to say that we would wish to see pay equality in relation to teaching, yes."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. You emphasise\u00a0'in relation to teaching'\u2014my next question is that, of course, within FE establishments you have teaching staff and non-teaching staff, and if there was to be some sort of increase, then would you not expect all staff to have that?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Well, let's see\u2014that's up to ColegauCymru\u00a0to negotiate and to discuss, so let's see what the outcomes are."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Because some of the non-teaching staff are the lowest paid, as well, aren't they? So, you know\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Let's wait for the outcome of the negotiations. I think we are very aware of the situation. ColegauCymru are in that negotiation. We're aware of what the requests are from the trade union members, and we'll wait to see what they come up with before responding formally."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Could I just briefly as well ask about pensions, because that's coming down the line, potentially, isn't it, and the impact that's going to have on FE? One college was saying it will cost them \u00a31 million if it happens next year. Are you thinking about any steps that you could take to support them, potentially, because obviously this is coming down the line, really, isn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Well, I think, already, we've got the situation in relation to teachers, and again what we've seen is the consequential and the UK Government honouring that. Again, what we don't have, necessarily, is that money coming down from the UK Government for us to be able to support it in the way that we might like to. It's early days on this, but it's something, again, we're keeping an eye on."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "The fundamental question, really, is: if the money doesn't come down the line from Westminster, are you in a position to underwrite that?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "Well, we'll wait until we see that situation arising, but we're aware that that is an issue that we're going to have to deal with in future."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Diolch."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "In relation to the pay dispute, it's the committee's understanding that ColegauCymru's position is that, in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers, an additional 3.5 per cent or \u00a310.1 million is needed. Are you aware of that being their position?"}, {"speaker": "Eluned Morgan AM", "content": "We are aware of their position, yes."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. The final question is from Hefin David."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "You will have had, Cabinet Secretary, a letter from\u00a0Professor Colin Riordan\u00a0on 26 September regarding essay mills, in which he refers to the other letter that was sent by him and 39 vice-chancellors regarding essay mills and the fact that it's legalised cheating. In the letter\u2014it was actually to me\u2014that was copied to you, he says: 'We have requested the UK Government commission the QAA to publish a draft Bill by or before the beginning of the next parliamentary session. We've also requested the Department for Education give support to the establishment of a UK centre for academic integrity, which would research, analyse and combat academic misconduct. Any support that the Welsh Government can provide in this regard will also be appreciated, so I'm copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education.' Can you just give\u00a0me your opinions on that, please?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think 'legalised cheating' is a polite way of describing what goes on. My officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the UK Government to see if we can co-ordinate a UK approach, which I think is necessary. I don't think there's any merit in us trying to do this on our own; it would be pointless. I hope that we can agree a formal approach as quickly as possible, and I will take every opportunity\u2014. We're trying to establish a meeting with the UK Minister for HE before Christmas, and I will take every opportunity that I can to ensure that we can take some very, very strong action in this regard. But it does have to be done at a UK level. I want people who attend our universities and who work hard to achieve the grades that they get not to be disadvantaged by people who look to find an easy way out and are not willing to put\u2014. I think it undermines the individual effort of individual students who are doing the right things, as well as the integrity of our system. I'm proud of the quality of the system that we have in the Welsh HE sector, and I want that maintained. I hope that we can agree a UK approach to ending this practice."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. And in addition to the specifics regarding the quality assurance agency and the proposed\u00a0centre for academic integrity, let's be clear: what we're talking about it outlawing those websites\u00a0that offer to write essays for cash."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes. And quite often, very bad ones as well. [Laughter.]\u00a0My understanding is\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Well, they get through the system and they guarantee\u2014. The websites, and I've experienced this, and I mentioned it in First Minister's questions\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "You did."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "The websites\u00a0say to you, 'Unless\u00a0you tell anyone, you won't get caught', and students are believing that. The new student grant system\u2014some of that money will go to these websites."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Absolutely, and, unlike you, I have no experience of this myself\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Well, I have experience of it. I've not done it, but I've experienced it. [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I'm so old, Hefin, that such internet sites didn't exist when I was a student. [Laughter.] But, you know, I'm sure you listened to it too: a recent article, on a radio station, where, actually, it was an experiment just like you did\u2014a student deliberately\u00a0went through this process to expose, but, actually, what they got in return wasn't even very good. It was a particularly poor essay on the portrayal of women in Victorian literature, so they weren't even getting very good value for their money. [Laughter.] But, clearly, this is a terrible and abhorrent practice in our system, and, as I said, I will do everything that I can to work with colleagues across the United Kingdom to find a solution to this. If I thought it would help if we did it on our own, we could do that, but it won't help if we act unilaterally. It has to be a UK approach."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And just\u2014final question\u2014with regard to the representations you've made, do you feel that the UK Government is open to this course of action?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, officials are the ones who have had those direct, face-to-face conversations, rather than me. I hope to do that when I meet the Minister, hopefully before Christmas. Huw, would you like to comment?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Morris", "content": "We haven't had anything formally, but I understand from what I've heard in England that there is an interest to do something. Whether that will take the form of a Bill in the timescale you've outlined, I'm not sure, but as the Minister said, we'll be exploring that with officials through the ministerial meetings."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering all our questions? As usual, you'll have a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much for your time. Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education regarding eligibility criteria for free school meals. I'd like to return briefly to that when we go into private. Paper to note 2: a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill. Paper to note 3: also from that Minister, which is his response to the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee on the Bill. And paper to note 4: also a letter from that Minister to the Finance Committee on the Bill. And the final paper to note is from Mind Cymru regarding the task and finish group on a whole-school approach to mental health, and I will update Members on that when we go into private.\u00a0Happy to note those? Item 4, then: can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you."}]}

It 's alright ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Um . {vocalsound} Well it was just amazing to {disfmarker} to see uh how {disfmarker} how instable the whole thing is ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Maybe you 're done , then ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "and if you just take the {disfmarker} And I g I got the feeling that we are {pause} the only ones right now who have a running system . I don't know what the guys in Kaiserslautern have running because e the version {disfmarker} that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work . And you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work . And so it 's {disfmarker} And even Tilman and Ralf sort of said \" yeah there never was a really working version that uh did it without th all the shortcuts that they built in for the uh October @ @ version \" . So we 're actually maybe ahead of the System Gruppe by now , the system {disfmarker} the integration group . And it was , uh {disfmarker} It was fun to some extent , but the uh the outcome that is sort of of scientific interest is that I think both Ralf and Tilman {disfmarker} um , I know that they enjoyed it here , and they r they {disfmarker} they liked , uh , a lot of the stuff they saw here , what {disfmarker} what we have been thinking about , and they 're more than willing to {disfmarker} to um , cooperate , by all means . And um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal \" group - ware \" server at EML , make that open to all of us and them , so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and {disfmarker} and generating and constructions w we {disfmarker} we sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there and maybe we can even um , get some overlap , get some synergy out of that . And um , the , uh {disfmarker} If I find someone at {disfmarker} in EML that is interested in that , um I {disfmarker} I may even think that we could look {disfmarker} take constructions and {disfmarker} and generate from them because the tree adjoining grammars that {disfmarker} that Tilman is using is as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism . And you can just do anything with it , whether it 's syntactic trees , H P S G - like stuff , or whether it 's construction . So if you ever get to the generation side of constructing things and there might be something of interest there , but in the moment we 're of course definitely focused on the understanding , um , pipeline ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Anyth - any other {vocalsound} {comment} uh repo visit reports sort of stories ? uh we {disfmarker} so we now know I think , what the landscape is like ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "And so we just push on and {disfmarker} and uh , do what we need to do . And one of the things we need to do is the um , and this I think is relatively tight {disfmarker} tightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff . So . Uh . And I was going to switch to start talking about that unless there 're m other more general questions . OK so here 's where we are on the belief - net stuff as far as I understand it . Um . Going back I guess two weeks ago uh Robert had laid out this belief - net , missing only the connections . Right ? That is {disfmarker} {comment} So , he 'd put all th all the dots down , and we went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there . Yeah {comment} we may run across one or two more . But of course the connections weren't . So , uh Bhaskara and I went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief - net computations and was there some known problem with them or had someone already uh , solved you know how to do this and stuff . And so Bhaskara tracked that down . The answer seems to be uh , \" no , no one has done it , but yes it 's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that 's what you set out to do \" . And , so the current state of things is that , again , starting now , um we 'd like to actually get a running belief - net for this particular subdomain done in the next few weeks . So Bhaskara is switching projects as of the first of June , and uh , he 's gonna leave us an inheritance , which is a uh {disfmarker} hopefully a belief - net that does these things . And there 're two aspects to it , one of which is , you know , technical , getting the coding right , and making it run , and uh stuff like that . And the other is the actual semantics . OK ? What all {disfmarker} you know , what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate .

And this {disfmarker} we 've not uh worked on this yet . Um , yeah .

Um you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a {disfmarker} an HMM system is that you use {vocalsound} um three states per phone and um {vocalsound} so then the {disfmarker} the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Um . {vocalsound} Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use {vocalsound} uh models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . They 've got those initial and final null states . And so um {vocalsound} {vocalsound} their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five {vocalsound} which um , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each ."}, {"speaker": "Professor A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "PhD B", "content": "And so they had sixteen .

So my guess about what 's happening is that {vocalsound} you know , if you assume a fixed {disfmarker} the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models .

So that 's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close uh mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation .

And if you figure out well what 's the {disfmarker} there 's a {disfmarker} a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself {disfmarker} adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract {disfmarker} essentially to subtract off uh different uh {disfmarker} different reflections . Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had {disfmarker} you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there 's a {disfmarker} there 's an echo . It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those .

OK ? So now , if you um try to r you {disfmarker} To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons , but I {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the {disfmarker} the room response , but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the {disfmarker} the effect of some of the echos . Um , a number of people have done this so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it . So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach . You say I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I want to use this uh {disfmarker} this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos . So you construct a filter , and you have this {disfmarker} this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh {disfmarker} gets subtracted off from the original speech .

Uh . {vocalsound} Um"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc B", "content": "Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that , or is it a different type of reverberation ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Brian 's {comment} Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma . Right ? Which is what I was calling the \" party line \" , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want . We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position , and there might be , you know {disfmarker} There 's also um oh yeah , noise . So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise . It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , Then we 'll figure out the right {disfmarker} the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those {disfmarker} those echos . But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted so that it 's decision about what the right {disfmarker} you know , right {disfmarker} right uh {disfmarker} delays are {disfmarker} is , uh {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} right delayed signal is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} uh is incorrect . And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a {disfmarker} in a situation that 's very reverberant {disfmarker} {comment} with long reverberation times {comment} and really long delays , it 's {disfmarker} it 's sort of typically impractical . So for those kind of reasons , and also a {disfmarker} a c a complete inversion , if you actually {disfmarker} I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics . Um , that 's difficult because um often times the {disfmarker} the um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable , and so , if you {disfmarker} you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and {disfmarker} and uh goes to infinity . So it 's {disfmarker} so there 's {disfmarker} there 's {disfmarker} there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents {disfmarker} I mean there 's all sorts of {disfmarker} all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion , and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion , and um we decided to do this approach of taking {disfmarker} uh , just picking uh features , which were {disfmarker} uh will give you more {disfmarker} something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation , and that 's what Brian was trying to do . So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was {disfmarker} I was gonna bring up . Uh . Let 's see . I guess you {disfmarker} you actually already said this thing about the uh {disfmarker} about the consent forms , which was that we now don't have to {disfmarker} So this was the human subjects folks who said this , {comment} or that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} ?"}, {"speaker": "Postdoc B", "content": "The a apparently {disfmarker} I mean , we 're gonna do a revised form , of course . Um but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings . She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form .

I forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "What I was gonna {disfmarker} Right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "So something like , um {disfmarker} Well , there 's an example {disfmarker} the textual example at the end has clausal construction . So , um , just to show it doesn't have to be beautiful It could be , you know , simple old text as well . Um , there are a couple of {disfmarker} Uh , these three have various ways of doing certain things . So I 'll just try to go through them . So they could all have a type at the beginning . Um , and then they say the key word construction"}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Oh , I see ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "and they have some name ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "So {disfmarker} so the current syntax is if it s if there 's a type it 's before construct"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Yeah , right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "OK , that 's fine ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "OK , and then it has a block that is constituents . And as usual I guess all the constructions her all the examples here have only , um , tsk {comment} one type of constituent , that is a constructional constituent . I think that 's actually gonna turn out to m be certainly the most common kind . But in general instead of the word \" construct \" , th here you might have \" meaning \" or \" form \" as well . OK ? So if there 's some element that doesn't {disfmarker} that isn't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning . OK , um , the main change with the constructs which {disfmarker} each of which has , um , the key word \" construct \" and then some name , and then some type specification , is that it 's {disfmarker} it 's pro it 's often {disfmarker} sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is . So for example whatever I have here is gonna be a form of the word \" throw \" , or it 's gonna be a form of the word , you know , I don't know , \" happy \" , or something like that . Or , you know , some it 'll be a specific word or maybe you 'll have the type . You 'll say \" I need a p uh spatial relation phrase here \" or \" I need a directional specifier here \" . So - uh you could have a j a actual type here . Um , or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type . So a very common example of this is that , you know , in directed motion , the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind , often a human . Right ? So if I {disfmarker} you know , the um , uh , run down the street then I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I run down the street , it 's typed , uh , \" I \" , meaning category is what 's there . The {disfmarker} the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair and , um , sort of skipping fonts and whatever . The idea is that sometimes there are , um , general constructions that you know , that you 're going to need . It 's {disfmarker} it 's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase , or something like that there ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "And usually it has formal um , considerations that will go along with it ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "And then uh , you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you 're talking about , about what meaning {disfmarker} what specific meaning you want . So the example again at the bottom , which is directed motion , you might need a nominal expression to take the place of , you know , um , \" the big th \" , you you know , \" the big {disfmarker} the tall dark man \" , you know , \" walked into the room \" ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "But because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it 's nominal of some kind but in particular , that it 's some kind of animate nominal , and which will apply just as well to like , you know , a per you know , a simple proper noun or to some complicated expression . Um , so I don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types . So . OK , then I don't think the , {comment} um {disfmarker} at least {disfmarker} Yeah . {comment} None of these examples have anything different for formal constraints ? But you can refer to any of the , um , sort of available elements and scope , right ? which here are the constructs , {comment} to say something about the relation . And I think i if you not if you compare like the top block and the textual block , um , we dropped like the little F subscript . The F subscripts refer to the \" form \" piece of the construct ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Good ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "And I think that , um , in general it 'll be unambiguous . Like if you were giving a formal constraint then you 're referring to the formal pole of that . So {disfmarker} so by saying {disfmarker} if I just said \" Name one \" then that means name one formal and we 're talking about formal struc {comment} Which {disfmarker} which makes sense . Uh , there are certain times when we 'll have an exception to that , in which case you could just indicate \" here I mean the meaningful for some reason \" . Right ?

OK , and so in terms of the {disfmarker} the relations , you know , as usual they 're before and ends . I should have put an example in of something that isn't an interval relation but in form you might also have a value binding .

But I think we want to be uncommitted about whether it 's used for matching or not . Right ?

So you see it 's \" scenario \" , \" referent \" and \" discourse segment \" . And \" scenario \" is essentially what kind of {disfmarker} what 's the basic predication , what event happened . And actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would draw {disfmarker} draw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ? Um , and obviously there are other ones that are not included here , general cultural frames and general like , uh , other action f"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "you know , specific X - schema frames . OK , whatever . The middle thing used to be \" entities \" because you could imagine it should be like really a list where here was various information . And this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a referent {disfmarker} uh , you know , about some entity that you were going to talk about . So \" Harry walked into the room \" , \" Harry \" and \" room \" , you know , the room {disfmarker} th but they would be represented in this list somehow . And it could also have for instance , it has this category slot . Um , it should be either category or in or instance . Basically , it could be a pointer to ontology . So that everything you know about this could be {disfmarker} could be drawn in . But the important things for grammatical purposes are for {disfmarker} things like number , gender , um {disfmarker} ki the ones I included here are slightly arbitrary but you could imagine that , um , you need to figure out wheth if it 's a group whether , um , some event is happening , linear time , linear spaces , like , you know , are {disfmarker} are they doing something serially or is it like , um , uh I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not sure .

But {disfmarker} Um , and then the \" status \" I used was like , again , in some languages , you know , like for instance in child language you might distinguish between different status . So , th the {disfmarker} the big com and {disfmarker} and finally \" discourse segment \" is about {vocalsound} sort of speech - act - y information structure - y , like utterance - specific kinds of things . So the comment I was going to make about , um , changing entity {disfmarker} the entity 's block to reference is that {vocalsound} you can imagine your discourse like situation context , you have a set of entities that you 're sort of referring to . And you might {disfmarker} that might be sort of a general , I don't know , database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to . And I changed to \" reference \" cuz I would say , for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it . And those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here . For instance , I know it 's going to be plural . I know it 's gonna be feminine or something like that . And {disfmarker} and these could actually just point to , you know , the {disfmarker} the ID in my other list of enti active entities , right ? So , um , uh , th there 's {disfmarker} there 's all this stuff about discourse status . We 've talked about . I almost listed \" discourse status \" as a slot where you could say it 's active .

How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas, and is it something of a mixed bag?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "It's gone well, but I'm glad we've done it through this process of early implementer, actually piloting it, because we're learning lessons as we go along. It has gone well. It's been encouraging, to the extent that we're at the point where we're expanding\u2014we've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons. But, in terms of what we're learning, one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we're taking, because it's being done on the\u00a0seven early implementers. So, we're asking parents to come in, provide their wage slips, provide the birth certificates, and so on. You're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds, so it's difficult. And the burden of administration on that is falling to each pilot area. In one case, it's a whole authority, but it's only one\u2014that's in Blaenau Gwent. In others, it's smaller areas. So, we're also hitting those\u2014. The other big challenge we're hitting is communication. So, we're having parents, generally, who are outside the areas entirely saying, 'Why haven't we got this yet? Can we please get into it?', which is encouraging. But the other thing we're having is people who are within pilot authorities, where it doesn't extend to the whole authority, saying, 'Well, hold on now, we think we qualify for something under universal care, we think we qualify for something on tax credits. Why don't we qualify for this?' 'Well, you're not in the pilot area.' So, we're learning about these things, but the biggest one, I have to say, is the administrative burden, and I think that's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "What is the administrative burden? What specifically is that?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "It is that sheer burden on each local authority, and each pilot area, to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility, to bring in documents to prove their eligibility, to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are, what their salary slips say. It's incredibly bureaucratic. So, yesterday, when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, we made clear that our preferred option, as put within that framework Bill, is actually to build on, and to learn from the lessons as well, the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model, where you actually have\u2014and this, by the way, is supported by local authority providers out there\u2014one system that is a centralised system, where there is clarity, that is handled, that has elements of information sharing between Government departments, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, and so on, so that the work is done for the parents, and the work is done for the local authorities; much cleaner, much simpler."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "We are very confident. But, as I say, I'm more confident in the fact that we're actually piloting it, and phasing this in, because I think we've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere, including just over the border in England, where they have a different version of a childcare offer, but they've gone for it in a big-bang approach. And it has led to technical issues, it's led to volume issues, where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it, and the complexity, I have to say, of individual family situations, whereas what we are doing, Hefin, is taking this forward very, very carefully. Each roll-out, each expansion that we're doing of the pilot is not\u2014and I know this has caused some people to come back and say, 'Why can't we all have it now?' It's because we're only rolling out\u00a0to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it's rurality or, as it will be within\u00a0densely urban areas,\u00a0where the cost might be slightly higher, and that's allowing us to have the confidence that we'll have it. We've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd\u2014the whole of Gwynedd, Anglesey and Caerphilly. Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer.\u00a0Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September. Swansea is planning to do it, they tell us, in due course\u2014in short order\u2014as well. So, we\u00a0have the confidence now that, with that learning going on from different pilot areas, we'll have the full roll-out by 2020."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Is it true to say that, in the early adopter areas, the intensity of demand for\u00a0the services is not spread evenly across?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Absolutely."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And why is that? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "No, it won't cause a problem. If we were doing this tomorrow, it would cause a problem, but what we're learning is that\u00a0there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues. So ,there are issues to do with\u2014. It's not capacity, by the way. We're not finding a problem here\u00a0with capacity,\u00a0whether it's in English language provision or whether it's in Welsh language provision,\u00a0whether it's in children with complex needs, we're not finding\u00a0that as an issue. But what we are finding is, for example, one of\u00a0the well-known ones\u2014and I've spoken\u00a0about\u00a0this before\u2014is that, in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies, there is a\u00a0family tradition of doing childcare\u00a0within\u00a0the families. I've done it myself. Grandparents, aunts, uncles and so on provide free, unregistered,\u00a0unlicensed childcare of a sort. Now that\u00a0isn't what the scheme is about, by the way, I\u00a0have to say. So, some of the aspects are cultural, but what we're also doing\u00a0alongside this, whilst looking at the capacity and looking at how we\u00a0learnt from the pilot roll-out, is that communication with\u00a0parents and providers and local authorities as well. So, we have a whole programme running alongside it. It's about communicating what the offer is, how\u00a0simple it is to get invovled in this and\u00a0where they go to, and, critically, I think, how we do that national roll-out would be important as well."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, given the point you've made about\u00a0grandparents and family, wouldn't it be sensible, then, to offer a subsidy to\u00a0grandparents to provide this kind of care?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Unregistered grandparents?"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Well, through some kind of analysis of that."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Well, we don't think so and there are good reasons behind this."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Is it because you say that they wouldn't be registered as\u00a0carers for their own family member?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Yes, but there's a deeper reason behind that\u00a0registration as well. The childcare offer isn't only to just provide childcare; it's the wider aspects\u00a0that come\u00a0with this.\u00a0This childcare offer ties into\u00a0the foundation years offer. There's an element of education linked to the\u00a0childcare offer\u2014there's that 10\u00a0hours of the early education foundation years as well. The two tie together. So, there's an issue here with quality, about socialisation and how children learn in an environment, as opposed to purely\u2014as great as all our grandparents and aunts and uncles are\u2014simply child-minding. That's one\u00a0important distinction. So, the\u00a0focus of this scheme is very much on registered\u00a0licensed providers, which could be, by the way\u2014because we do have them, and we're discussing this at the moment internally and with the\u00a0Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years\u00a0and others\u2014grandparents\u00a0who are actually registered and\u00a0inspected by the care inspectorate? We're having\u00a0those discussions."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "How many of them are there?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "We don't think there is a huge number, but we're trying to\u00a0bottom this out at the moment. We haven't got\u00a0the exact number, but we don't think they are huge numbers, but there are, in our constituencies, registered, licensed, inspected grandparents who look after other\u00a0people's children in a little group of four or five or six or seven, but also their own grandchildren."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, they're a kind of grandparents club."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Yes. Now that, I would say to you\u2014and I know that Darren raised this on the floor yesterday as well\u2014is markedly different in the nature of it, because it's\u00a0registered and licensed, than simply informal grandparents or aunts or uncles. I say that as well\u00a0because we also get\u00a0people who will say to us, 'I don't\u00a0want to be paid for looking after my grandchildren; I look after my grandchildren\u00a0because I look after them'."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And what about the view, given that you said that\u00a0capacity\u00a0wasn't an issue, of the National Day Nurseries\u00a0Association, which says that Wales has the most fragile childcare sector in Great Britain?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "I don't agree we have the most fragile, but the childcare offer gives us an\u00a0opportunity to make it more\u00a0resilient and more robust. We know from the\u00a0early piloting, and as we roll it out, that there is the immense diversity\u00a0within the childcare sector, and we're talking about\u00a0everything from those very small terraced homes that have been licensed and registered to take six or seven children,\u00a0to large, complex environments that perhaps\u00a0are on maintained premises within school premises, provided by a voluntary or third sector organisation. So, there's immense complexity and we know that that differs across Wales, and we also know there's immense regional variation in the scale and the type of childcare offer. What the roll-out allows us to do, backed by \u00a360 million of capital money behind it, in terms of capital development of childcare facilities, backed by a 10-year workforce development plan for childcare\u2014and bear in mind this is bolted in as part of our foundational economy approach as well\u2014that means, by 2020, we get to the point where we're putting the money into the capital development but also to the workforce development, because\u00a0in some areas we're finding it's not to do with lack of provision and facilities, it's to do with lack of staff. In other areas, we're finding there are plenty of staff but not the adequate facilities. We've got to get it right."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "That's fair enough, but is it realistic to think that there's going to be capacity growth in the next two to three years to deliver the product? Is that realistic to think that that foundational sector can provide that level of staffing?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Yes, I think it is, absolutely, because, again, what we're finding is we've got several things going on at once in terms of how we monitor and assess the development\u00a0of this roll-out. One is the work that we're doing on the ground with the phased roll-out, so we're literally learning live time, and I have pretty much weekly or fortnightly updates on how things are going, but also there is a termly update as well. We've also commissioned additional work from\u00a0Arad to look at this first phase of the roll-out that we've done to see what that tells us as well. But the feedback that we're getting from the childcare providers themselves, on the basis that we're now identifying where either the gaps in the workforce or the physical facilities are, is that, 'Yes, we can do this', because\u00a0we're putting the money in, we have the strategy for the workforce development, and it's not going to be the same in all parts of Wales. It's not as if what we're saying is, 'Here's what we're going to do all of a sudden\u2014flick a switch and we have a universality of the same type of provision everywhere.' So, let me give you one key example. Alongside this, alongside\u00a0the \u00a360 million capital fund, alongside\u00a0the workforce development, we've also identified a separate\u00a0strain of money into cylch meithrin. We know that there is a shortage in parts of Wales for Welsh language childcare development. We're specifically putting money into developing that, and, in fact, the first one of those will be, from\u00a0that new tranche of money, opening up, I think, in September. They anticipate, as part of our big strategy with Welsh language development, we'll have an additional 40 of those by\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "Thirty."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "It's an additional 30 by 2020, and an additional doubling of that in the 10 years\u00a0after that.\u00a0We can't take this for granted, Hefin. This is difficult. This is hard work, but we have everything in place to make it happen."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "The last thing from me: the \u00a34.50 single national rate\u2014is there a danger that we might be creating a kind of EasyJet-style nursery provision where you get the basics but the wealthier parents are going to be able to pay for better care within those settings because\u00a0of the add-ons?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "We really mulled over this a lot and discussed it, I have to say, not only internally but with childcare providers out there and with parents as well and with local authorities. The\u00a0first thing to say is the \u00a34.50 rate that we've set has been welcomed, and it's been welcomed because it's unlike the much more complex offer that's in England, where there's a variable rate and there are lots of determining factors on it and it's added complexity\u00a0and confusion."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Can I just ask there, it's been welcomed perhaps\u00a0in Blaenau Gwent, but has it been equally welcomed in Cardiff?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "No, because\u00a0we haven't rolled it out in Cardiff yet, and that is a salient point."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay, fair enough. But will it be, then?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Yes, it will be. Some of the more expensive areas like Cardiff and Newport are knocking on our door saying, 'Please can we have this offer?', and we are keen to give it to them. But, as I say\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "But do you anticipate\u00a0a capacity\u00a0problem with the \u00a34.50 in those areas, compared to, say, the Cynon valley?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "We can't anticipate\u00a0it yet,\u00a0Hefin, but that's exactly the reason\u00a0for going into that area and then assessing how it works. We're reasonably confident that the \u00a34.50\u2014. We're reasonably assured by the feedback that we're having that the \u00a34.50 might work as a universal amount. But if we learn, when we roll it out in Cardiff and Newport, that there needs to be some variation, we can look at that, because we're not doing a big-bang approach. So, that is part of why we will move to roll it out within Cardiff and Newport and other more expensive areas and learn from it, but at the moment, I have to say, the \u00a34.50 amount has been welcomed\u2014it's appropriate. You touched on the other aspect, though, of the wider aspects of beyond the \u00a34.50, because\u00a0the \u00a34.50 doesn't cover everything.\u00a0The \u00a34.50 is a contribution\u00a0towards the wraparound childcare element but it doesn't cover\u2014and we agonised over this\u2014the issues of things like transport out on trips or food or snacks and things like this. Now, we did agonise a number of things that brought us to the conclusion where we are. I have to say, this hasn't been ivory-tower stuff; it's been in discussion with the providers but also parents.\u00a0One: parents are quite used to\u2014with childcare settings and play care settings and so on\u2014the idea that providers are quite different. Some providers charge a fee that does everything in one; others provide simply the childcare element but they tell the parents\u2014and I'm used to this as a parent myself, although mine are older now\u2014'Mr Irranca-Davies, when you sign on, just to be aware, if we do take your kids down to St Fagans, there's going to be a little bit of a charge for that' and so on."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "That's fair enough, but it would be the lowest-income working families who would be most unduly affected by that, because the higher income families would be able to afford those add-ons, the lower income ones won't. Isn't that a concern?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "If money was absolutely no object, then I think you'd be looking at quite a different offer, but it has to be affordable within what we've got as well. The fact that parents, including those who are on lower incomes, are used to currently discriminating between providers, not only with childcare settings but also within school settings as well, where very often schools now will say, 'We're doing something extra'\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "That may be the case, but it's not fair, is it?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "In a pure argument about equity, and if funding was no object and if the burdens of austerity were released and we were told we had money\u2014'You can do what you want'\u2014I think you'd be looking at a very different approach. But within what we have, I think this works very, very well indeed, because it's very transparent for parents who are used to making these decisions. It says, 'Here you have 10 hours of the foundation education offer. You have the additional hours here provided with the childcare offer. But\u00a0within those additional hours, you may be with a local provider in the middle of Powys that actually says, \"Within that we provide everything\"; you may be with a provider that says, \"Well, actually, we do a whistles and bells thing and we take them out on trips, but it's up to you if you want to come, and here's the additional cost\u2014\".' Parents are used to making that decision and realistically, in terms of what we can do with this offer, this is actually\u2014the arguments around this have been well rehearsed both with providers and with parents and we're not getting any concerns that this is going to unnecessarily\u00a0disadvantage. In a total fairness argument, would you make it universal and with no additional charges? Well, possibly you would.

But, secondly, there is an appeal to universality, curiously, in saying to all parents\u2014and I say this regardless of political hues across the committee here\u2014there's an attraction when you say, 'Let's make an offer focused on working parents as it is', as universal to those working parents as possible, and avoid the administrative costs of saying, 'Well, let's take the upper limit down to \u00a380 or \u00a360 or \u00a355.'

By the time it's fully rolled out, of course, that \u00a34.50 rate is going to be a number of years old, for example. Do you have plans to review that? Where is it headed?

The reason we've gone for the other areas first, by the way\u2014please take this back to any authorities affected\u2014is simply because we've done deep dives into areas that vary from very rural areas in mid Wales, areas in north Wales, areas around Welsh language provision, areas in deep valleys, understanding\u00a0the cultural and the economic impacts. So, we've held back a little bit from going into what we know is an obvious challenge within the more expensive areas of provision. But it's coming, it's imminent, and we'll learn the lessons from it. And do you know, you may be right? And if you are right, that it's more expensive, and we need a higher rate within\u00a0those areas, then we're going to have to come back and discuss it with the committee.

I think part of the evaluation from Arad will also show us that\u2014whether or not, within the pilot areas that we are already in, which are quite diverse, that is happening. We're only one term into learning the lessons, by the way, but I would want to make sure that we design a scheme where we are not heaping on disadvantage or where there was exploitation of disadvantaged families. So, the early evaluation, I think, will give us good feedback on that. I think also, by the way, that providers know that this is a collaborative effort to do this here. It's not in their interests, I have to say, as the umbrella bodies or individual providers, to see this as some way that they can unduly rake in additional income from this on the backs of poorer families. This is about providing opportunities for all working families. But especially, I have to say, the early evaluation that we've seen already suggests that the greatest proportion of those who are taking advantage of this scheme in the early parts\u2014in the early evaluation\u2014are those who are below the average working wage within in Wales. That's by far the greatest number of people who are doing it, and we don't want them then being priced out because of add-ons. So, there has to be some pragmatism, I have to say, and some open partnership working here with the sector, and we do have that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "John on this."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "I want to come back to the \u00a34.50 rate, but in terms of working with the sector, briefly, if I might, Chair, I just wonder, Huw, in terms of that \u00a34.50 figure and understanding the sector in Wales, to what extent are we talking about a market rate and to what extent are we talking about the increase in demand that will come from the scheme and how that relates to economies of scale and capacity? Is it purely a market rate or is there a conversation with the sector in terms of the benefits that will come from this scheme and how they should be recognised in terms of setting the rate?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "This has been a very open dialogue with the sector around affordability, around the hourly rate and around what might happen in future as well. This is not a pure hard data-driven analysis that says, 'Here we've calculated everything and this is the rate that will satisfy it', because we recognise that there's great diversity in provision out there, and we also recognise that things will change over time. It's not only the geographical diversity\u2014it's the diversity of the sector itself. I think we need to, as we take this scheme forward and look at the full roll-out, continue in that very open dialogue with the sector not about what is purely a market-driven amount but actually what is also affordable for the Welsh Government within the constraints that we have. Just to flag up one issue, it's right that we're focusing on those elements that aren't included within it, to some extent as well, and the effect of that on more disadvantaged families, but that has to be balanced with the pocket of affordability for this scheme as well. Let me give you a clear illustration: some of our calculations have suggested that if we included free food within this offer as well, it would add something like in the region of 50p to that \u00a34.50 rate. That would have, at this moment, impacts on the affordability of this and the roll-out of it. I would need to be going back to my seniors and arguing the case now, okay? But, it's that open dialogue with the sector that says, 'There's one thing about what you're saying you demand as a market; there's another thing about what we're saying that we have affordability from taxpayers' money to actually put into this'. They also understand, John, that as well as an enabling policy\u2014and we're seeing the evidence, by the way; I can cite it\u2014of individuals who are being helped into more flexible options to get back into work, increase their hours and so on, this is also about building capacity in a fundamental foundation sector that is in every single part of Wales. The stuff that's being debated ad nauseam here within the Assembly about foundational sectors\u2014. The sector itself understands that if we boost the childcare offer in all its diversity, including, by the way, not just the independent sector but social enterprises and third-sector organisations, such as exist in Neath and elsewhere that I was involved\u00a0in 20 or 30-odd years ago setting up\u2014that has an economic impact that goes beyond that immediate family who are receiving the provision to the wider communities as well. They know that. They know there is job creation within this and there's economic impact for that. So, it's an open dialogue on what the rate should be rather than purely, 'Our wonks have crunched the numbers and we've come up with \u00a34.50.'"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "David, you had a question on the pilots."}, {"speaker": "David Rees AM", "content": "Yes, just to finish that section off, if I may, Chair. Before I go to my question, I want to come back to Mark Reckless's question and the answer you gave. I got the impression that if there is a need to look at different rates because of the higher-end areas, you may therefore have different sets of rates and not a universal rate. Is that also on the cards?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "David, it's possible. I think our preference would be, I have to say, to stick with the universal rate, because we know it's\u2014. There's real simplicity and it's been welcomed in the sector. But the sector, also, are quite pragmatic about this. One of the defining hallmarks of the way that we've taken this scheme forward is learning in live time as we pilot and expand the pilots into different areas and different types of provision. If we learn lessons from that that suggest we need to come back and look at a differential in more-expensive-to-provide areas, then we'll have to look at that, but there might be other ways of splicing it. But first of all, I think we have to go in and see how does this work. We might find, Mark, we might find, David, that we go in and when everything is tallied up, the \u00a34.50 per hour works in supporting provision there."}, {"speaker": "David Rees AM", "content": "Okay. In your answer to John, you talked about affordability, which I totally understand.

In the situation regarding Welsh-medium, you answered that a little bit earlier, but I have concerns about capacity. Workforce capacity you've mentioned. To actually be registered you need staff who are qualified. There's clearly a need to get more staff, because in your own paper you say that the report in 2016 said you do not have the childcare capacity in Wales at the moment. Do you believe that you can actually deliver the workforce to meet that capacity, first of all through the English medium, but secondly through the Welsh medium as well? Because there's a clear need to look at it. You talk about 30 by 2020. By the way, 30 is nothing big when you consider the whole of Wales. Do you actually think you've got that workforce capacity set up before this is fully rolled out?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "I hope, Chair, you'll appreciate that in our submission to you we've been very open. This is challenging. This is. To get to where we want to go is a huge challenge. Can we do it? Yes we can. And I don't say that glibly. Let me suggest some of the ways why. We have confidence that we can do this if everybody is working together across the sector, across the local authorities. Let me talk broadly about capacity, first of all, including English and Welsh-medium provision for children with complex needs, provision for children with disabilities\u2014all of this. First of all, this is being\u2014. The work that we're doing to increase both capacity in terms of trained staff and qualified staff: we have the 10-year plan that I mentioned, which has already been announced. We're working through it. We're working through it with the sector. So, we're identifying not only broadly at a national level where we need to develop those qualifications, but also at a regional, geographic level as well, and that's being taken forward. We've engaged with the 22 authorities\u2014not just the pilot areas as well on this. So, beyond the pilot areas, we also have intense engagement. As you can see from what I've said before, it's rolling out progressively, but with all 22 authorities we're working with them on their childcare sufficiency assessments to identify where their shortages are."}, {"speaker": "David Rees AM", "content": "What have the pilot programmes actually shown you about this, and how are you going to move this forward?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Well, it's precisely that. So, within the pilot areas, we have a greater depth of analysis now of where both the workforce and the physical provisions are. Whether those are maintained or non-maintained or third sector or school facilities or whatever, we've got a much deeper granulation of identifying where that is, and we're working, then, with those authorities, with the capital moneys that we've allocated to this and the workforce development, and with local colleges, to develop the workforce and the physical constraints. But we're also doing that with the other 22, with all the 22 authorities as well, in anticipation of the wider roll-out. They're not being left out of this. And by the way, it's not only the Cardiffs and the Newports; it's all the other ones where there isn't full roll-out. We're engaged with them deeply at the moment with that analysis on their childcare sufficiency assessments, both in terms of workforce, but also physical provision. So, we're doing that already. We are looking as well, as this is rolled out, around the issue of co-location. Now, co-location is a fruitful way to look at future development. It doesn't mean, by the way, that we exclude the third sector or social enterprise approach, or the independent sector, but co-location could be key to the roll-out of this in the right areas where it can be done, because then we avoid any\u00a0fracture between the education hours and the childcare hours: the physical transportation of children from one location to another. So, we're engaged with the 22 authorities on that: where could that be developed, who would be the providers that would do it and do they have the workforce to scale up to do it? If not, how do they talk to local colleges to do that? So, we're doing that at the moment. I mentioned we've put the \u00a31 million additional funding into the meithrin over the next two years, targeting\u00a040 new Welsh-medium groups by 2021, which pretty much coincides with the full roll-out of this. It's part of the aim of an additional 150 over the next decade of meithrin. So, all of those things, David, give us a confidence that we're going to be in the right place."}, {"speaker": "David Rees AM", "content": "But in particular, take the Welsh language\u2014I understand Gwynedd, and I won't ask another question on that for obvious reasons at this point in time\u2014but in some of the other areas where you've piloted, you've gone partial in some areas. When there's Welsh language education, and the three to five-year-olds go to schools, they go from all areas of the council, basically. They don't actually go necessarily from the local area, and therefore you're getting a different picture. Have you been able to assess the actual impact, properly, upon the Welsh-medium side of things? Because, for example, my grandchildren will go from my area, which may not be in one of the considerations, to a school that may be in that consideration, and that happens regularly."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Absolutely. We know that historically we've got, across the country, a shortage of Welsh-language childcare provision\u2014meithrin and so on\u2014but we have not only a strategy in place, but the fact that we've got local authorities now doing their own assessments within their area, across the piste of childcare, but also in terms of Welsh language, that means then that we can start filling those gaps with the money we've put to it, and that includes in all parts of Wales, including those areas within south Wales and others that are less deep in their tradition of speaking Welsh over recent history, anyway, but where the demand for it is massive. So, local authorities are tasked with doing their own assessments of childcare sufficiency for this childcare offer. They're identifying the gaps, David, and we will work with them and with providers to fill those gaps, and that includes with the umbrella organisations for Welsh language childcare provision."}, {"speaker": "David Rees AM", "content": "And that's the same for those children with physical disabilities or learning disabilities."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Absolutely the same. Absolutely the same. And this does mean, Chair, that it will be different, as it currently is in different areas: the type of provision, where the provision is located. But the provision should be there. This offer won't happen unless the provision is there for those children with complex needs, children with disabilities, Welsh language provision, as well as more generic provision as well, but it will be diverse in its provision around areas."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "I do want to move on now, John, so if I can come back to your question. Llyr."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "I would like to pick up on the last point, if I may."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Thank you. The investment in meithrin, of course, is one that we all welcome. A question from me though, the wider question, is: how do we mainstream Welsh medium into childcare? Because, clearly, leaving it to meithrin is one way of doing it, but there's a lot of existing infrastructure out there that we need to upskill in terms of the provision of Welsh medium. So, it's not a question as such, but I'm sure you recognise that\u2014that there is a challenge there. Because if we are to get to where we want to get to, it isn't about growing meithrin, or Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin; it's about mainstreaming Welsh-medium provision within the wider sector. So, it wasn't a question after all. So, looking at the manifesto commitment that was made in 2016, clearly the main or the principal aim of this policy is around removing some of the barriers to secure employment for parents, albeit with very positive outcomes for the children themselves, and we don't ignore or neglect that at any cost. But I'm just wondering: how would you then reconcile that with the findings of the Public Policy Institute for Wales report, which I mentioned to you yesterday, which was commissioned by the Government to look at policy options in this context, which concluded that there will be no 'substantial impacts on net income, poverty or work behaviour for families with children' and that 'the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers in families with a child of target age is extremely small'?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Well, the first thing I would say is that what we're learning from the pilots is that it is having real-life impacts on parents, including in disadvantaged families, and we're having this fed back from real-life situations on the ground, where parents are making different choices in the areas where it's being piloted. So, the types of different choices they're making could be to expand the number of hours that they're in work, because they now have a choice, they're not constrained to certain hours or whatever, they have a wider choice, with a wider number of providers, and they're making that decision and they're able to expand their hours. Some, by the way, Llyr,\u00a0I have to say\u2014and, again, these are real-life situations\u2014are saying, 'What we're doing is not expanding our hours, but, because of the increased provision of childcare and the increased offer, we are now able to actually spend more time with our children, because we're adjusting our hours of work, based on the childcare provision offer.'\u00a0That in itself, I have to say, is a worthy aim. But I would say what we found out, in real-life examples\u2014I'm not saying that in direct contrast to what that paper was saying\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "That's what I was going to ask; it sounds as if you're saying they were wrong."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "But what we have is the advantage of this phased roll-out, where we are learning, live time, and I think the Arad report in October\u2014we're hoping to see the final report in October\u2014will help put some flesh on this as well. It is already having an effect: the majority of parents who are taking advantage of this are actually in those groups that are below the average wage, they are making positive choices to get into this offer and to either expand, take more hours, adjust their own lifestyles around it or more. So, it's having a positive effect. I can cite to you examples, because I've asked my own officials on this, of families who tell us they're saving up to \u00a3250 a week on the basis of this offer within the pilot areas, who've increased their hours of employment, who've changed their working patterns to suit their work life, but also to suit their families. Now, that's real stuff, as opposed to\u2014yes."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So, in effect, you are saying that the PPIW\u00a0report got it wrong, basically."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "No, I'm not saying that they got it wrong and it's wholly wrong, but it is interesting, within that report, that it did identify that there were a range of factors here that play upon this. It's not only the childcare; it is the transport, it's the training and education, it's the employment support and all of those. And we agree with that, but we do think, and what we're seeing, live time, at the moment\u2014maybe at some point, somebody else will produce a report beyond the Arad\u00a0report in October that will say, 'Well, actually, the way this is designed, that they've done it in Wales, is having a material effect on those families, particularly the most disadvantaged families.'"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "But you're asking us to support a Bill here, albeit a framework Bill, to achieve a policy aim where you're giving us anecdotal evidence that it's having an impact, contrary to research that's previously been done, albeit with promises that, maybe, an evaluation sometime in the autumn might tell us a different story."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "We know, and we are constantly told\u2014I'm sure this is commonplace in constituency surgeries, as well\u2014by parents who say that the biggest mitigating factor for them, actually, either going into work at an earlier opportunity or expanding their hours is purely the cost of childcare in front of them. We are picking up, even from the early term of the analysis\u2014. I think our further reports, both Arad and as we go forward with the pilots, will substantiate this more. It'll go beyond the anecdotal, it will show that parents are having an enhanced opportunity to balance their work life, to make better choices, either in terms of expanding the number of hours they're working and increasing their disposable income within their families, or actually making it simply better for them in their family situation, where they don't currently have that offer. So, I get the fact that we have one report out there, but it's one report. It's a report, and we're not dismissing it entirely, but what we are saying is: we are now working with real-life piloting of an offer, and we are seeing the benefits coming through. As we roll this out, we'll be back in front of this committee saying, 'Well, this is now what we're finding. We can go beyond the real-life stories that I'm relating to you now, and we can say, \"Well, here's some hard data that goes with this, as well.\"'"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Okay. You reference in your paper, as well, another report, which is the\u00a0Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u00a0report, 'Starting Strong 2017', and it highlights countries that have, maybe, the most similar childcare offer to what's being proposed here in Wales. I'm just wondering what assessment you've made of those similarities, because, clearly, there'll be different economic contexts in different countries and different levels of public expenditure, et cetera."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "We haven't done really detailed analysis of comparisons with other countries far from Wales, but we will be doing work\u00a0that will be doing some benchmarking against, where we can find similar models, where appropriate\u2014do some appropriate benchmarking. What we have been doing is looking at what's been happening across the border in England and trying to learn from the lessons there, and also the offer in Scotland as well, which are both close to hand. They're in quite similar contexts. But we will do some work, Llyr, around benchmarking against good comparative international examples, where appropriate."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Yes, there we are, because one of my concerns was that the focus in a number of the countries in the OECD report are for nought to three-year-olds, whereas, of course, the policy focus here is for a slightly older age group."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Yes, and I fully get that, but again, and I know it can be said, 'Well, this is an example' but it's real-life examples. We are having people who are telling us that they're now making the choice to go to work earlier because\u00a0this is extended to three-year-olds, but they would have delayed. There is a direct outcome\u00a0there if this childcare offer enables somebody to say, 'Well, I'm going to go a year earlier back into work and bring income into the family.'"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "Okay. So, moving on, then, to the impact on the child and this whole question around school readiness, of course, which is an important one to address. Clearly, one of the main outcomes of this policy will be the academic performance of children, hopefully, later on in life. I want to come back to this point that the Children's Commissioner for Wales and others have raised: the concern that, actually, the most disadvantaged\u2014those from workless households\u2014are being excluded from this policy. Isn't there therefore a risk that they'll be left even further behind?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "I've had long, detailed and positive discussions with the children's commissioner on this, and I know the children's commissioner would want a more universal offer, but I make two points on that: one is, that was not what the commitment in the manifesto was, and it's not the offer that's being taken forward now. It is a different thing, a universal offer, and there\u00a0are issues around that with complexity, and also affordability. But it isn't the offer that we took forward into Government; this is what we're taking forward. But it is interesting\u00a0in terms of that aspect of families then who lose out. I'd say two significant things on it: one is, this doesn't stand alone purely as 30 hours of childcare. Within this, there are 10 hours of the foundation years, educational input, which is there for everybody. But before that, particularly for those disadvantaged families, before we even get to that stage, you have schemes such as Flying Start, and I know this committee has looked in detail at Flying Start and has said that it would like to see it rolled out everywhere. If I had all the money under the sun, I would really do that, Chair; I would really do it. But I don't have all the money under the sun."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "But you do have the ability to target the money."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Yes, but the fact that Flying Start, we know, is leading to those outcomes where those children, in quite challenged circumstances very often, are more ready to step up to the foundation year, are more ready, then, to step through into mainstream education in later years\u2014those things tie together. So, there are the 10 hours of education provision that sits here for every family, by the way, within this offer, let alone the childcare. That doesn't mean that everybody's excluded, but it does mean, yes, that this offer is focused on working parents. And we don't think that that's a bad thing. In fact, it does overlap with other offers that other political parties were taking forward into the last election, which was focusing on how we support the biggest thing that we often have in our constituency mailbags, which is, 'I can't afford to go back to work because I can't afford the childcare. Don't tell me to go back to work, I can't afford it.'"}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "The majority of disadvantaged children don't live in Flying Start areas, do they?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Yes, indeed."}, {"speaker": "Llyr Gruffydd AM", "content": "So, there's a missing cohort there that can't access one or the other, and the school readiness gap is growing, and, really, are we focusing our resources in the right place here?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Well, yes, in terms of this scheme, but it doesn't sit alone as this scheme\u2014it's the wider plethora of, I have to say, progressive and advanced initiatives that we have in Wales that take different\u00a0forms. It's not only Flying Start that provides that other support for parents, and readiness not only for the parents and for their children, but also the support into work. So, if, for example, you look at the Parents, Childcare and Employment programme, which is separate from this, there is support there for every parent in terms of helping them get supported into work from disadvantaged families. If you look at the support for the children, we've got the 10 hours that sits within the sphere of the education, but we've also got all the other family intervention programmes that help with socialisation, education and so on and so forth. If you look at this solely on its own and say, 'Well, there is nothing else there;\u00a0the rest of Wales is a desert and there's no support for parents, for getting parents back into work or for\u00a0those parents who are not seeking to go back into work but also need the support and for their children in education',\u00a0I'd be worried. But, actually, this fits as part of the jigsaw that we have in Wales, where I think we are well ahead of the other nations. Yes, we could do more, and I always say, Llyr; I always say, Chair, that if I had\u2014I don't have a chequebook at all, because it's not in my gift\u2014if I had a blank cheque I'd do a lot more, but we don't. But what we can do is get the right schemes in place, and if this helps drive more choices for working parents, including, by the way\u2014.\u00a0There are niceties within this as well; it doesn't have to be that both parents are working. You could have a parent who is on incapacity benefit. You could have a parent who is a registered carer. They would qualify for the scheme. Those will be some of those most disadvantaged families that we both have those concerns about. So, there is some flexibility within this scheme as well to deal with some of those disadvantaged families."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Darren on this."}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "I am surprised by the answer there,\u00a0particularly given that one of the ambitions of the Government is to close this attainment gap later in life when schoolchildren get to their examinations, when they're 16 years old. Yet this appears to be driving a bigger wedge in terms of development, which could, of course, lead to a perverse outcome later on in life, but I don't want to ask you about that. If I can just very quickly ask you: has consideration been given to making free childcare available to parents where they're in 16 hours or more of education each week? So, they may not be entering the labour market, but, of course, one of those barriers to them getting back into the labour market could well be their education, so what arrangements are in place there?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Darren, we have considered it, and we haven't included it within the scheme because this is designed to enable parents to go into work, not into training to enable them to get into work.

It doesn't fit within the offer so, as such, why would we do the costings?"}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "Perhaps I can frame my question in another way. Are you prepared to consider it if you're able to identify the numbers and potential cost?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Ah, right, okay.\u00a0We'd be interested in your thoughts as a committee, but it doesn't actually fit within the first principles of what the\u00a0scheme is designed to do. Darren, can I just pick up on your point, in case you misinterpreted what I was saying to Llyr?\u00a0I drew attention in my answer to Llyr\u00a0to schemes such as the PaCE scheme.\u00a0In Gwynedd,\u00a0one of our pilot areas, they\u00a0are combining the Team Around the Family with this childcare offer. So, what they are doing is wrapping the support around. It is not the case, as you've suggested then, that there is somehow more disadvantage being heaped on other families. What this does is tie in in those pilot areas with the existing provision, and that's\u00a0the way we want to see it work. So, I wouldn't want you to be under any misapprehension that this makes conditions worse for families. Those families who have a registered carer in them where one parent works, and those families who have somebody on incapacity benefit will qualify for the scheme.\u00a0All families will qualify for the 10 hours\u00a0of education. In Gwynedd, they're wrapping the Team Around the Family with this offer\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "But on the other hand, Minister, you've also suggested that this will accelerate child development for those kids who are able to access it, and yet not all kids will be able to access it, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "But all children can access the 10 hours, and they can access Flying Start\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "But 10 hours is very different to 30 hours, is it not?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Yes, but they can access Flying Start or they can access the Team Around the Family\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "If they're in a Flying Start area."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "\u2014or they can be in a children's zone area or they can\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Darren Millar AM", "content": "If they're in those areas."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Right, I've got John and then David, and the questions and answers are going to have to be brief, please."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "Yes, certainly, Chair. In terms of child development and how this fits with wider\u00a0Welsh Government strategy, Huw,\u00a0I'd be interested in what you'd have to say about the quality of childcare.\u00a0We're talking a lot about quantity, but obviously we want to up quality, and that's recognised by Welsh Government. They've talked about increasing the qualifications within the workforce, and the quality. I just wonder how that sits within the \u00a34.50, because there could be pressures in the opposite direction there, and some tension between wanting to up the qualifications and quality of workforce whilst keeping affordability in place."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "John, you're absolutely right, and two things on that: I visited one of the facilities in the Valleys the other day that was taking this forward\u2014a very good independent sector-run childcare provision, with Welsh language and English language running alongside each other, and I asked the point about the integration, curiously, but\u00a0what they were doing was\u2014. Their standard of staff was an exemplar of what we'd want to see: not only very well-qualified childcare staff who were qualified within not simply the child-minding but the wider child development aspects\u2014. So, it was hard to differentiate, in some ways, what was happening there from what would be happening in a child development educational surrounding, and including the nutritional stuff and all of that. Now, that is the model we need to see, and the \u00a34.50 seems to work, at the moment, for that. It'll be interesting, as we discussed previously, as it goes forward\u2014. We need to look at whether that works, going forward. But the quality, I think, is key, and that's why we're focused very much on registered inspected providers, as opposed to every Tom, Dick and Harriet."}, {"speaker": "John Griffiths AM", "content": "If we want to increase salary levels, though, which I think is a necessary part of this picture of improving quality, then obviously that might impact on the \u00a34.50 rate."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Yes, indeed, and we are cognisant\u2014. It's interesting that we focus on whether the \u00a34.50 is affordable, but the \u00a34.50\u2014you know, we're having an interesting discussion internally about how that \u00a34.50 offer per hour sits alongside others, such as the foundation phase offer, and it's more generous. So, I think it's: how do we align, as time goes by, the child development aspects of the whole early years stuff? Now, we're doing some fascinating work that I think I've referred to on this committee before about aligning the early years development entirely. Now, this is an evolving piece of work, but I think the childcare offer should ultimately fit within that. How do you make sure that every offer that is Government-funded works on child development? It's not simply childcare."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. Right. The next questions are from Mark."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "In terms of child development and not accentuating disadvantage, another area where this may apply is the kids who are born in the summer term, compared to those who are born in Michaelmas. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that they start with a disadvantage at school and often don't make that up, even as they go through school. What is the rationale for providing the older children with five terms of this, compared to three terms for the younger children who already have the relative disadvantage?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "I'm looking to my colleagues here and\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "Well, the criteria for eligibility for the offer are the term after the child's third birthday, which is equivalent to the eligibility criteria for the foundation phase early education offer. Clearly, then, the number of terms that a child is able to, or parents are able to, access the childcare offer will be influenced by when the child is born,\u00a0but I think you may be referring to a sort of parallel question, which is about whether\u2014. There have been questions raised about whether children who are summer-born should, in fact, start school in the term after they turn four, or whether actually they should be allowed the flexibility to start school at a later age, which I know is something that has been tested in England, and there is some mixed evidence about school starting age and the birth month of children."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Well, they do have flexibility. You don't have to start your kids until the term following when they're five.

Doesn't\u00a0that make the situation worse?"}, {"speaker": "Jo-Anne Daniels", "content": "I'm not 100 per cent sure I understand the question.

What do you say to that?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Well, Mark, I can only refer to what\u00a0I said earlier.

And the fact that we are having parents already saying to us that their ability to actually extend that into the 48 weeks\u2014beyond the term time and so on\u2014carries advantages that are not picked up in that report."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "I think, from recollection, we're one term in, so we're one term into the assessment, and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of \u00a326,000 in Wales\u2014 it's around about 60 per cent of families are those. We're finding very few families are those who are on higher incomes. It's disproportionately towards those below the average income, and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered. So, clearly, they're seeing the benefits of it."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government\u00a0offer of tax-free childcare that's applicable across the UK?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Well, that offer, as you rightly say, is available across the UK and still is. The fact that it's more integrated within their scheme within England\u2014the tax offer is more integrated\u2014has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they've had. That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say, 'Well, we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours', but this 30 hours is there for every\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "I wonder, Minister, whether what you're doing, in a very good way, to promote your project\u2014people will see that as the childcare offer and, at least in my experience, very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis."}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "You're right\u2014sorry. That's absolutely one of the lessons we've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers, because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer, within universal credit, within working tax credit. There are little bits of different ones and it does cause confusion. So, one of the lessons that we've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access, how they access it easily, and we'll learn more as these pilots roll by."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "So, as you go into the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs criteria\u2014you have a \u00a3100,000 cap, as well as the \u00a36,000 minimum wage cap, and you're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible, which requires them to set up that account with HMRC\u2014will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer, and that their providers also are? Because we've been looking, say, at the \u00a37.50 extra per day, but, if someone's eligible for this offer, they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that. So, will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds, rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts, which might otherwise happen?"}, {"speaker": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM", "content": "Yes, absolutely. And I think, if it's okay, Owain would like to add something as well."}, {"speaker": "Owain Lloyd", "content": "Yes, just to say, as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC, when a parent applies, that automatically happens in terms of, on the one hand, they're given a 'yes' or 'no' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England, but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that's set up under TFC. So, that is integrated in the offer, and we'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer. But, obviously, what we're not looking at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly, rather than the TFC model, where the parent pays the provider."}, {"speaker": "Mark Reckless AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Okay. Well, we have come to\u2014well, we've run over, actually. So, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending? You are, of course, back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill, so we will look forward to seeing you then. You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy, as is usual practice.

That's me . Uh {disfmarker} Come on . {gap} . Ah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh {disfmarker} for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set . Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . No cords attached . And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . Uh well the same idea here . Uh message to the television . And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh {disfmarker} and maybe uh teletext or something like that . Uh well these are two uh remotes , and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh {disfmarker} We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . Or uh uh more functions on the remote . Uh maybe more devices you can influence . Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ . {vocalsound} Yeah well that's our dilemma . Um any ideas about that ? Basic or multifunctional ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "We'll got back on that later ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay yeah . Yeah well the {disfmarker} that was just on my mind ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go .

Then it's your turn , the marketing expert ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay . Uh um m Yeah . {vocalsound} Um yeah okay . This bit too far . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So {disfmarker} So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at uh several um things . Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . Uh well what what will be our market . And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not . Well our findings . Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . Uh well they also zap a lot . So uh zapping uh should be very easy . And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . There is more findings . Uh on the buttons . Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? And how much would they use them ? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection . And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . Uh not important they found the audio , uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often . Then we have a few um graphs about the market . Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I {vocalsound} I think the younger will be most interest in it . But uh they are not a very big group . Um in the {gap} we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it . Now you can clearly see young users say {gap} . I will {disfmarker} that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change {vocalsound} I think ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And they won't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . Well here we see the same . Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . And old users not . Uh well we uh found out that there are two {disfmarker} several markets at which we can aim . Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . And um they are more critical on their money spending . Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent . So the the first group is bigger . Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . Uh yeah the first question is uh {disfmarker} also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . But less of them will buy it . Um well I uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay . What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use , remote control . So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Um well th uh that's my second point ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . It's about discussion we had earlier . Um {disfmarker} You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . Um well the design is very important . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . But they found most remote controls very ugly . So the design of our remote control is very important . And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that .

Uh next sheet ? Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . Uh , furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use . {vocalsound} Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . So we have to focus on those three thing three things . And in the end I'll um show you our target {vocalsound} audience or our target product users , customers . Well , {vocalsound} um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "That's seventy five per cent of the current users . They don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . Um {disfmarker} They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control . {vocalsound} Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . Furthermore , it's uh {vocalsound} seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot .

Uh ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "You see ?

Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . Um {vocalsound} We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start {disfmarker} talk a little bit about tool training . Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . Um I {gap} guess you know game or something um {vocalsound} in real life um so yeah basically I want to {disfmarker} I'm just gonna {disfmarker} you got {disfmarker} of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about um {vocalsound} uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . {vocalsound} Um so um if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , um {vocalsound} y is"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound} You're just gonna believe me ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "we'll go from there ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Exactly .

Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . {vocalsound} Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics .

And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um {vocalsound} I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me {vocalsound} tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible um to try t of sync it all up . So that's the detailed design . So it's a three stage kind of thing . Um right so for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it , I haven't tried it yet either um I'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around um and just write down {disfmarker} I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you {disfmarker} if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um .

Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee this afternoon?

In accordance with Standing Order 34.21, notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting, which was published last Thursday. This meeting is, however, being broadcast live on Senedd.tv, with all participants joining via video-conference. A record of proceedings will be published as usual. Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely, all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place. The meeting is bilingual, and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available. Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally, so there's no need to turn them on and off individually? We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM, and there is no substitution. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting, the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin? Moving on, then, to item 2 this afternoon, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales.

How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people, and their role in transmitting the virus? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government's exit strategy, especially in the context of reopening schools?"}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "Okay. I think it's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact. It's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions, and in particular the age grade that we've seen, and that's underpinned the advice we've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories, as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield. We still don't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus, and this is one of the difficulties we face. Because in cold and flu, children transmit the virus and they're also susceptible, in particular to the flu, as well; that's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well. We do know that there's some developing evidence about what's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome, but that's affecting very small numbers of children. We have one possible case in Wales\u2014a child who's in critical care\u2014but that isn't confirmed. That's still a developing knowledge base. So, the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too. But the generals still apply\u2014that children are less likely to be affected than older people, but can nevertheless still become unwell, and that's, if you like, one of the few positives in this condition. But as I say, we're still learning, so I won't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And in terms\u2014[Inaudible.]"}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "Chair. Sorry. Excuse me, Chair. Sorry\u2014with apologies to the Member, my translation stopped after a while, so I heard the first part translated, and then it just fell off. I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked, and don't think that's fair to the Member or other members of the committee."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Can we check that translation is back on, please, and maybe Si\u00e2n could repeat her question?"}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "I can hear it, yes."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, Si\u00e2n, would you mind repeating that, please?"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Not at all. I was discussing NHS services, including critical care services, and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase. We, of course, hope that there won't be any increase, but should there be an increase, particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus\u2014let's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales\u2014do we have the capacity in place to deal with these, and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children?"}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "At this point in time, the answer is 'yes', and there is always a significant caveat, though, and the 'but' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care\u2014. So, when we increased critical care right across the national health service, we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well. So, we can flex up our capacity. But the challenge in all of that this is\u2014it's part of my caution and the Government's caution about moves out of lockdown. So, it's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it, and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that. So, actually, we'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools, even on a limited basis, what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community, and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough, because, actually, one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we haven't had our critical care capacity filled up. It's been extended, and the extension has meant that we haven't been overtopped.\u00a0If we hadn't done that, we definitely would have been. And we'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose, and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently. But that's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment\u2014you don't know everything that's coming, and on this disease in particular, we do know that we're still learning with each passing day."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "[Inaudible.]\u2014Si\u00e2n?"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Hello. Yes, those are the questions I had on that section."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Lovely. Thank you very much. Right, we'll move on now then to some question on access to health services from Dawn Bowden."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. Minister, just some concern that you will have heard about in terms of parents and carers maybe not taking their children into the healthcare system for other conditions while the coronavirus pandemic is with us. How are you monitoring that situation at the moment and have you had to look at your own commutation strategy in relation to that?"}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "We've had to look at some specifics around communication, so challenges about not just different languages, but about how we get messages to people in a very different environment, and it's really challenging. So, for example, our health visitor service has absolutely not stopped. We've had to think about the way it works, and I had this conversation earlier this week with the chief nurse. But the bigger challenge are parents refusing to engage with the service. I understand people's fear and anxiety, but that then means that their family, and in particular their child, isn't getting the sort of proactive care that we would want them to have. So, there's a real concern both at the professional leadership end and for the chief nurse and for Ministers as well about how we can get through. That's actually about rebuilding people's confidence in the service, and that isn't straightforward because there's a broader concern about coronavirus still circulating. But I think for us it's really important to reiterate that we have thought again about how to provide the service. We've thought about how to protect staff and families and the very clear message to parents is to please make sure that when health and care professionals are calling to help and support your family, please discuss your concerns with them. We're doing even more remotely, via telephone and online as well. There are times you need to be physically in the same place, for example on routine vaccinations, because we certainly haven't stopped that programme either, and I really wouldn't want to see that one of the unintended consequences of what we've done is that if parents don't engage with that service, we could potentially see a rise in other diseases. We're all, I think\u2014not just you\u00a0in your constituency, but others who are on this call and\u00a0others as well\u2014seeing an occasional reappearance of measles, and that's because people didn't engage with the vaccination programme. I don't want, either myself or a different health Minister in the future, to be sat here talking about how in years to come the failure to engage in a vaccination programme has led to clearly avoidable but significant harm to children and young people and the communities they live in."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Jean, you wanted to come in."}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "You need to unmute yourself. Oh, no\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Professor Jean White", "content": "Thank you. I just want to add to what the Minister said. So, I approached the immunisation lead in Public Health Wales to see exactly what has been happening recently and they said at the very beginning of the outbreak parents were very reluctant about coming forward for their routine immunisations, but recently, through lots of energy from the immunisation clinics and the leads within it reaching out to families, that trend seems to have turned and there's now a much better attendance. One of the most important things we can do to protect our children is to make sure they have their vaccinations. So, yes, there was a bit of a downturn, but it does seem to be improving at the moment. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. And that answered my second question, Chair, so I'm happy to leave it there. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you very much. We're going to go on now to some questions about mental health from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "It's a cause of great concern to us all, of course, in terms of the impact of this crisis on mental health and well-being among our children and young people. So, what assessment has the Government undertaken of the impact on these aspects in young people and what work is being done to understand the impact of the pandemic? What longer term measures will be put in place and what support services will be put in place?"}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "Again, I think it's helpful that you've already heard from the education Minister last week, because I think the first of her key principles for returning to school is the impact on the emotional health and well-being of children. So, children's mental health was a central concern and remains so for both myself and the education Minister. Part of the honest challenge, again, is that we don't fully understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children but we do expect there will have been an impact. So, we're working together with both health boards and our own knowledge and analytical services across the Government to both try to further understand what that is and the difference. Until we have more contact with families, we may not fully understand that, and that's a real point of concern for me. In all of the unknowns within this, the impact on mental health and well-being is absolutely one of them, because we're looking at how we then develop not just a recovery plan for the economy but a recovery plan around mental health, how we support people, and that will have to be informed by the understanding of what's happening when we get more engagement with families about the level of need, and then how we need to think about that. Obviously, it's a key factor for their return to school, but, actually, for the life children and young people lead outside the school environment, and that will be difficult because we're going to phase out of lockdown\u2014it's not going to be a one-hit measure. That absolutely isn't going to happen. We're going to be looking at, at each point, what difference has been made, what more we can do. And, again, there are the efforts we're making to make sure that our online support services and our telephone support services\u2014that we keep on reminding people that they're there and are available, and we want people to make use of them, because I know, as this committee said, we'd much rather be able to support people and intervene earlier rather than wait until there's a much bigger problem in a period of months in the future."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "So, in reality, there's been no assessment undertaken because it's difficult to do that. So, the full picture in terms of the outcomes of the crisis\u2014you don't know what they are at the moment as things stand."}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "We can't know, because we don't have that level of contact. There is a development\u2014. I wouldn't say that no work's being done, but I couldn't tell you honestly that that work is finalised and we have a definitive understanding of the picture. If I tried to say that, then I'm sure you'd ask me, 'How on earth can you say that? If you're not having regular contact with people, you can't possibly understand the picture.' And it's much better to say, 'We don't understand the full picture. We know there'll have been an impact. We're working alongside health boards and others, but we'll know more as we carry on having more contact with families.' I'll look at a variety of different areas, again, both to reform the recovery plan, but also then to understand what we need to do at various points in the future, and the picture that we're seeing isn't straightforward and we need to make sure that we don't try to pretend to ourselves or to the public that there is a one-off measure that will allow us to be successful in all the areas that we'd want to be."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "But can you give the committee an assurance today that this area of mental health and well-being is going to be a priority for you as health Minister?"}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "Of course. Not just on the work we've done in the past; not just because it's one of the key principles for the education Minister about the reopening of schools, but it is a real worry list for me about how we understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and to move forwards, that we don't end up with an entire generation of children and young people who grow up with a range of damage because we haven't thought about what that will look like. So, the mental health recovery plan will of course be of very real importance to me. In amongst all the other priorities I have, I'm certainly not going to allow the mental health and well-being of children and young people to be forgotten."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And how does the current capacity in terms of child and adolescent mental health services compare to service capacity prior to the coronavirus outbreak in Wales? Have you had to shift some resources over from CAMHS, for example, in order to deal with more general aspects of coronavirus?"}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "No, we've actually got\u2014. Maybe perhaps it might be helpful, Chair, if Tracey Breheny could say something about the way that we're monitoring the impact we have, in terms of we've got a reporting tool, but also weekly contact with leads in CAMHS services."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Tracey."}, {"speaker": "Tracey Breheny", "content": "Of course. Thanks, Minister. Yes, on that question, we moved pretty quickly at the beginning of the pandemic phase to put in place, as the Minister said, a weekly monitoring tool of all local health boards, so through that tool, we look at that every week in terms of collecting information. Whilst national reporting's been stood down, we are picking up assurance through that tool on things like staff sickness in CAMHS services, referral numbers and so on, so we do have that tool in place, and at the moment, that's telling us that the system can meet the capacity; has the capacity to meet need."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Have CAMHS staff been shifted over to do other work during this virus outbreak?"}, {"speaker": "Tracey Breheny", "content": "There has been some movement, as I'm saying, around health boards, particularly where in the first phase of the epidemic the concentration was on in-patient provision, providing critical care, but my understanding is from the latest tool that we looked at last week, those staff are gradually not just returning to work from self-isolation or whatever, or from different parts of the system."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And then, what about the capacity for CAMHS primary mental health services? Has there been a reduction in that capacity since the beginning of the pandemic in terms of in-patients? Because that's what I'm hearing, that there has been such a reduction, but how are those patients then treated and served?"}, {"speaker": "Tracey Breheny", "content": "In terms of in-patient capacity, that is in the system in both the north Wales and in the south Wales unit at the moment. There were some discharges of young people, but we've had the assurance that that was only undertaken where it was clinically safe to do so and where the community support was in place."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And finally in this section from me, given that schools are of course closed and that schools are so very important in terms of signposting young people towards services, how can young people access appropriate services\u2014online services, for example? How are they signposted towards those services at the moment?"}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "Well, we've not closed off general practice and, as you know, we've expanded the ability for people to access services in an online manner. We've expanded a range of telephone advice services, so the telephone advice service we already provide, we've made sure that's maintained, and both myself and the deputy Minister have referred to that on a number of occasions. I think the real struggle and the real difficulty is actually how you punch through different messages when the broader news agenda is so overwhelmingly focused on headline messages in other areas. That is, again, a worry for me, but the communications we have within the health and care system, people should know where to refer people to and how to provide access to both telephone and online support that continues to be available, and actually, as I say, we've expanded that right across our healthcare system. That's what I\u2019m keen to see continue into the future. Whatever the post-COVID-19 world is, I don't want to miss out on the progress we have made in the online provision of services. Of course, most children and young people expect to be able to access services in an online manner already."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "But, of course, there will be some who are missed; they may fall between two stools because they won\u2019t know where to turn."}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "Yes, and that, again, comes back to our challenge of how we help children and young people in their context, with their families, to know where support and advice and guidance is. Many people are defaulting to their general practitioner if they can't find advice somewhere else, so that's why there's the information we're providing through general practice to signpost people, so those pathways haven\u2019t been closed off. It's about making sure that people have alternative means that they\u2019re prepared to use at this point in time. If we go back to where we started this evidence session, we were talking about the difficulty of families who don't want to engage in a traditional person-to-person contact or being in the same room as someone else or allowing people into their home. So, there's a real challenge about how we make the service available, but then encourage people to take it up, so that we don\u2019t see much greater harm that we have to try and resolve at a later point."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. I've got a supplementary from Suzy Davies, and can I remind Ministers about concise answers, please? Suzy."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, thank you. Just as we're speaking about children and young people's mental health, I wonder if you can confirm whether you've seen the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child's reports about what they call the grave physical and psychological effect on children and young people, and whether the operational guidance you've given out is responding to that in any way, or maybe there was something in that that you hadn\u2019t thought of and you can respond to as we go along."}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "I, personally, haven't read that advice, but the Government's already concerned about the direct physical and mental health impact of lockdown restrictions. You don't need to be a parent to recognise that that\u2019s a potential issue for children and young people. But, I'm sure\u2014. I haven't read it, but that's been signposted, so I can check with officials if they have and if that would change the advice and the position that we're already adopting, because we do regularly look at a range of advice from a range of sources, including the UN, the World Health Organization and others."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, and we are going to come onto children's rights. But, as you know, Minister, the prevention of young suicide is a cause that is very close to my heart. Can I ask what assessment the Welsh Government has made of an increase in suicide amongst children and young people during this pandemic and because of this pandemic?"}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "Apart from the general concern that I've expressed on mental health generally, we are already investigating, we're having a\u2014. We've commissioned, through the Government, the delivery unit to work with the national advisory group, including Dr Ann John and other people, to review the current, unexpected deaths during the start of the pandemic here in Wales, because we want to try to understand the wider concerns about the potential effects of the restrictions on the mental health and well-being of children and young people, and if that is leading to a spike in suicide or not. So, that's why we've commissioned that review to be carried out with the current numbers of unexpected deaths that we have, so we're able then to provide a report to understand where we are. My understanding is that we should have a report on that review before the end of this month and, obviously, I know the committee\u2019s got an interest, so if it's helpful we can write to you once we've had a chance to receive the report and to look at it."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Yes, please. Thank you. In terms of provision of crisis care, then, how has that been impacted by the pandemic? Are those crisis services available for children and young people who need them at the moment?"}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "Yes, they continue to be available. We still have seven-day-a-week crisis care. We've made clear that mental health services, including those for children and young people, are essential services to be provided. They're not services to be scaled down. They were not part of the series of measures that I stopped within the health service on 13 March. We have built up those crisis care services over a period of time, and the last thing we want to see is to see them disappear during this period of time when there are well-understood concerns about emotional and mental health."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Moving on to perinatal mental health, this morning I hosted a round-table with the NSPCC where we heard about lots of good practice that's going on in terms of supporting new mothers and their families in this period, but I wonder if you can tell the committee what you are doing as a Government to make sure that there is consistent perinatal support for all women across Wales in what is a difficult time for any new mother, let alone in a pandemic."}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "We continue, again, to provide our perinatal mental health service. That's not been stopped either. We've also been looking at how that's provided on a phone or online basis where possible, because again the same concerns exist about physical contact with people. So, we're looking to make sure that the progress isn't lost that we've made. We know there is more to go. So, the service may have changed, but it still absolutely exists. And again, part of the challenge in all of this is about the pause or the interruption in work to create the in-patient capacity that I've previously committed to. So, I want to understand what that really means, but again the problem is, at this point in the pandemic, I can't give you an answer about what that means for that in-patient provision. We're still committed to it, but I'm concerned about the time frame\u2014that is partly about the length and the extent. But again, I'm really impressed by the continuing commitment of our staff to deliver this service for women in what is a particularly uncertain time. It's difficult enough in terms of the challenge in terms of perinatal mental health in normal times, about people being prepared to come forward and then receiving the sort of response they'd want, and even more so now."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Is the Welsh Government aware that there's apparently been a decrease in the numbers of women being willing to look at mother and baby unit provision, and will you be taking that into account in your planning? Because, obviously, we wouldn't want people to think that was because of a lack of need; it's down to fear and the lockdown."}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "Yes, we're aware there's been a reduction in people wanting to make use of the service\u2014or being prepared to make use of the service is probably a better phrase\u2014because we know that's the same with a range of other areas. There aren't fewer people having strokes than there were at this period of time last year; the reason why the figures are different is the way that people are behaving because of their concerns about coronavirus. So, I certainly wouldn't be using this period of time to plan for the need that exists for a facility that we want to create. So, I'm happy to give that assurance, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. The next questions are from Suzy Davies."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. It's a straightforward one, really. Obviously, we have the detail of the third sector resilience fund and the\u2014there are two funds, aren't there, for third sector organisations? But can you give us some indication of how much of that support is being targeted to children and young people, and perhaps you can specifically mention how much of the \u00a36.3 million for hospices is for children's hospices? I don't mind who answers that one."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "The Deputy Minister would like to come in, I think."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes. Certainly, I'm sure the committee is aware, as Suzy has said, of the funds that are available for third sector services. The Deputy Minister and the Chief Whip, of course, announced on 6 April the \u00a324 million Welsh Government third sector COVID-19 response fund, and that of course is more than we would have had as a result of consequentials from the UK Government. They can also benefit from the \u00a3400 million economic resilience fund, but I am aware that some groups don't benefit from that and they may not qualify for that. So, we've also got third sector support being delivered by WCVA, such as the voluntary services emergency fund, which supports volunteering, and the third sector resilience fund, supporting organisations to stay afloat. We are working very closely with the third sector on issues such as support for fostering services, care leavers and repurposing funding so that they can support the crises. Voices from Care Cymru has developed a specific offer for care leavers, and the Fostering Network provides extended helplines. We've got lots of examples of third sector partners working with children and young people. Childline bases in Wales remain open and operational, and are still providing information and support. And, actually, about 50 per cent of contact with Childline at the moment is to do with COVID-19. NSPCC has put together a support page for young people about COVID-19. The NSPCC UK helpline have also reported a decrease in calls resulting in a referral to children's social services at the start of the lockdown period, but, since then, the numbers have actually risen. So, there are lots of examples of help for children. Meic, Action for Children, and, of course, Voices From Care Cymru have come up with their own specific package. In terms of the actual percentage that is being spent on children, I can't give you an actual figure for that, but, certainly, there are a whole range of projects that are there helping children. I think the Minister for Health and Social Services will be able to respond to the hospice question."}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "It's about \u00a31.5 million from the \u00a36.3 million that's gone to T\u0177 Gobaith and T\u0177 Hafan, Suzy."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you very much for that. So, it's about 25 per cent. Perhaps if you could ask the Deputy Minister, when she's in a position to do so, to let us have a note. Before we finish on this point, could I ask the Deputy Minister, again, about whether any of the things you've been talking about now is additional money, because, obviously, you mentioned yourself one of these funds is \u00a324 million. Some of the work you mentioned is continuity of existing work. So, again, if you don't have the answer to hand, perhaps you could send us a note in due course about how much extra is going in."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes. I think most of those things I mentioned are things that are already there, and the \u00a324 million is for support and extra help. So, any more information, I can send to you."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Lovely. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you very much. The next questions, then, are from Dawn Bowden on safeguarding and child protection."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair, and thank you, Deputy Minister, because one of the questions I was going to ask was around some of the work that you've been doing with the third sector on safeguarding and child protection, and I think you've covered that. But what I'm particularly keen to find out is how you're monitoring the impact of coronavirus on child protection and safeguarding in the round. I know the health Minister raised this as a concern in Plenary only recently, and it's really how we are monitoring it, what concerns have been identified, and how we're going to start to tackle some of those."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes. Thank you very much, Dawn, for that question. Obviously, it is difficult to monitor if there's not easy access to the children that we're referring to, and that's why we have been trying to encourage the vulnerable children to go into school or childcare settings. And there's been a lot of encouragement for that happen. The Minister, the director of education and the director of social services sent out a joint letter recently to all the local authorities, asking them to try to encourage the vulnerable children and the families to get the children to go to school. In fact, we've now got 890 vulnerable children attending school settings, and that's the highest number that we've had at all since the opening of the scheme. But it's still only a tiny drop in the ocean. But it's very good, and it is progress that the numbers attending are now going up. But, of course, there are a lot of children who are not attending school and the social services are not necessarily seeing. There has been a drop in safeguarding referrals to social services. Those numbers are now beginning to go up, but there certainly was a significant drop, which is a great deal of concern. One local authority, in fact, reported a drop of 27 per cent in terms of safeguarding referrals compared to this time last year. So, I issued a written statement on 1 May, setting out the work taken forward under our cross-departmental vulnerable children, young people and safeguarding work stream, and encouraging people to report any safeguarding concerns there are. Because, obviously, we are dependent on the public authorities\u2014you know, schools and health services\u2014to report any concerns, and at the moment, obviously, they're not there to report them. So, we have made this public appeal for everyone to look out for each other, and I was very interested in what Si\u00e2n Gwenllian told me about what was being done in Anglesey in terms of sending out a message via social media to get people to look and listen, and to raise their concerns, because, obviously, safeguarding is the concern of everybody in the community. But I think that we are reassured in terms of our contact with the local authorities that they are, in fact, keeping close touch, as far as they possibly can, with all the children that are vulnerable. For those where it is very critical, face-to-face contact is still taking place, and there are imaginative ways of trying to keep in touch with all the other children and families. So, it is a difficult situation and we are concerned about it, but I think as much as possible is being done."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Jean, you wanted to come in on that."}, {"speaker": "Professor Jean White", "content": "Just to add to what the Deputy Minister was saying, the health visiting service has not been stopped or stepped back. It has consolidated some of the ways that it does the Healthy Child Wales Programme, but, for those families that are identified as having particular need or have children that are particularly vulnerable, all the normal contacts have been maintained, so they're not unseen to the normal health visiting service. That covers both Flying Start and general health visiting areas. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Jean, for that, and, Deputy Minister, would there be any value at this point in actually revisiting the current Welsh Government definition and guidance around vulnerable children, in terms of who we identify as vulnerable? Because this opens up a whole new group of children that are not necessarily known to services but can still be vulnerable. So,it's just looking at the current guidance that we have. Do you think that needs revisiting at all?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "The definition of vulnerable children and young people includes those with a social worker and with statements of special educational needs, and the most vulnerable of these should be prioritised. But we have now looked at this again, and we've set out an expanded definition, and we intend to publish that this week. This does include discretion for local authorities to have some flexibility and to be able to offer a place for those who may be on the edge of receiving care and support if they are known to be vulnerable by the school or by family support services. Because, obviously, the children that we know about, we know about, but there are those other children who may be on the edge of care\u2014the children that we've been trying very hard, as part of our policies in the Welsh Government, to keep with their families, with a lot of support. Those are the ones that we also want to support. So, we are giving discretion to the local authorities in order to have a degree of flexibility, and that will be published this week."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you. Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. We're going to move on now, then, to talk about looked-after children and children on the edge of care, with questions from Janet Finch-Saunders."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. Can you set out the impact the coronavirus emergency has had on the care system, including edge-of-care services, and where have there been areas of concern?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, local authorities have obviously had to change their working practices in response to the COVID emergency, so a red-amber-green rating\u00a0risk assessment was adopted by all local authorities at the start of the pandemic to ensure that vulnerable children and families receive the right way of receiving services and the frequency of contact from the services. This is being dealt with on a case-by-case basis, so every case that is known is being RAG rated and services are being linked to that. Also, there is very close contact between Welsh Government officials and the local authorities. There are weekly meetings between officials and the heads of the children's services. I can't speak too highly, really, about the amount of support and mutual work that has been going on. We've been assured that there have been no significant increases in the numbers of looked-after children, and the number of placement breaks are minimal. The other interesting good point is the children services workforce remains at 90 per cent plus, and, obviously, that is a great testimony to the dedication of the workforce. So, there's very close contact. The children are all being monitored individually, and I think in the circumstances we're all doing what we possibly can. I know that Albert Heaney is able, probably, to respond in more detail to the contacts, if you'd like to have that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "I think we'll move on to the next section. Can I remind everyone again: sharp focused questions and concise answers? Janet."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thanks. How is Welsh Government ensuring that vulnerable children have access to the necessary technology to maintain contact with their social workers and other support workers and networks?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "It is normal practice to ensure that children and families do have appropriate access to technology to keep in touch with social workers, so that is part of our normal practice. We're very keen as a Welsh Government that no children are left behind in their education during this period. So, last month, as you will know, the Minister for Education announced \u00a33 million of funding to help digitally excluded learners so that they've got access to the internet, so that they can fully participate in online learning. So, we do normally ensure that they've got digital contact for social workers."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. Can you set out the picture regarding children's residential care? What are the challenges these care settings are facing, and have any children's homes closed?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Residential children's homes are not really reporting any particularly difficult issues, and certainly they have been able to resolve any issues that have happened. So, I'm very pleased to report that. We obviously expect all children in residential care to be supported, and to keep contact with their families and with their siblings, and that is going on, although it may be by technology rather than face to face. We know that some young people have found the social distancing a challenge, and I think it\u2019s easy for us to understand that they have found that quite difficult. So, there have been a few issues related to that, but, where that has happened, local authorities have been able to resolve that on a case-by-case basis, and really there are not any major issues. In terms of residential care, Hillside is functioning well\u2014no reporting issues. The staffing levels are normal. There are fewer children and young people there, so, in fact, there's been an opportunity to give a great deal of attention to the children, and I think we've had very good reports about how that has happened. So, I am absolutely reassured by our officials here that everything is as well as it could be. I also meet with the children's commissioner once a week, who is an independent source, and she said when I met her last week, 'Well, as far as we know, it's all good news'. So, I don't think we have any concerns at the moment about the residential care."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay. Moving on to foster care, how is Welsh Government working with local authorities to meet the challenges set out by the Association of Fostering and Adoption Cymru and its fostering guidelines?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "We have worked with the fostering organisations. We have had close communications with them, and we've supported AFA Cymru to develop guidance for foster carers, and that guidance has been very strongly welcomed across the sector. We're working with the third sector. I think I mentioned before specific issues such as support for fostering services and, of course, care leavers. The Fostering Network has extended its helpline hours, and, of course, Voices from Care\u2014I mentioned them before\u2014have developed this particular offer of support for care leavers. I've been reassured, as well, from Voices from Care that the young people appear to be more stable now\u2014that they have contact with. But that's online help for them. So, we have had quite a lot of contact with the fostering services."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "So, the final point on that, then: the Fostering Network and others, as you know, have called for foster parents who can temporarily no longer foster due to the current virus emergency to be paid a retainer, with all foster carers receiving extra financial support for additional expenses. What is your position on this, please?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, we haven't had any specific representations from local authorities asking for support for foster carers, but some local authorities have paid retainers and some people, I believe, have increased the amount of money that they are paying. They've also given support for various activities and things\u2014have helped sometimes, I think, with broadband access and that sort of issue. And, obviously, foster carers who do require additional support should be approaching their local authorities or the independent fostering agency."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. Albert, I just wanted to check there wasn't anything you wanted to add, please."}, {"speaker": "Albert Heaney", "content": "Thank you very much, Chair. I think the only thing to add was relating to monitoring. The Minister has indicated that we are speaking weekly with heads of children's services, and we do now have a data collection that's been implemented to capture the critical data in relation to the children's services. So, that will assist us in our monitoring arrangements going forward. Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you very much. And the next questions, then, are from Suzy Davies."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. I just wanted to have a quick answer from probably the Minister, I think, about the primary legislation and the regulations that followed, about which children's rights impact assessments have been done. Have any been done, and can they be shared with the committee if they have? Sorry, Deputy Minister\u2014my mistake."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, it's been a very difficult time, as you appreciate, in terms of having to make legislation very quickly, and it hasn't been possible to do the impact assessments that we would normally do. However, I am very pleased to say that we're actually launching a survey of children. We're going to be launching it next week. And this is to try to get from children their views of what's happened, what we've been doing, and their views on the whole COVID-19 situation. So, we're doing this in conjunction with the children's commissioner and with Young Wales and with the Youth Parliament. So, this is an online survey that we hope will be going out to thousands of children, and we will get their response in terms of what are the important issues that have arisen for them, what they feel about what's happened during this period, what they feel about the way that we've dealt with the schools, the way that they've had to cope in not going school and being at home for so long. And so we're trying to get feedback from young people. So, I'm very pleased that we're doing that, but, in terms of an impact assessment, it has been very difficult, as I'm sure you can imagine, to be able to do those at these times. I think that Albert wants to come in on that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, because I'll pursue that in a sec."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Albert."}, {"speaker": "Albert Heaney", "content": "Thank you. Thank you, Chair, and I think Nicola indicated before me, so apologies, Nicola. Just to say for the committee, really importantly, that we haven't introduced any easements in relation to children's services legislation. I think that's really quite crucial. So, from a Welsh context, the standards that are in place do remain, so therefore there wouldn't have been a necessity for us to do a children's rights impact assessment in relation to the primary legislation. I think that's particularly a strong point to us in Wales, both in terms of safeguarding arrangements, but also ensuring that children's rights are protected at a crucial time."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Nicola."}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "Thanks. In terms of childcare and education, we're obviously looking at the provisions under the coronavirus Act to allow us to maybe ease some of the statutory requirements, and we are going to be undertaking a full suite of impact assessments on those. Obviously, the coronavirus Act itself was UK Government legislation and they ran their own impact assessments, but, in terms of how we implement it in the childcare and education space\u2014and I think Albert was just saying the same thing\u2014we definitely will be looking at those impacts in terms of going forward."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Well, just to come back on that then, are you saying to me that, as a result of the various coronavirus regulations that we've had, no assessments for children's needs have been postponed, cancelled or done very quickly online rather than in person?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, I think, as Albert said, that there was no relaxation of regulation for children's social care. You know, that's\u2014there haven't been any in Wales."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "No, but that's what\u2014. There's no relaxation, but what's happening in practice? We're down on staff across all our councils and in our third sectors\u2014who's doing the children's needs assessments, particularly for young carers?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, I\u2014. Albert, can you answer that?"}, {"speaker": "Albert Heaney", "content": "I think the first thing to say to the committee is that, going back, we took a very strong line at the beginning that we weren't going to introduce easements in requirements to children's social services. Of course, through the way that practitioners and social work practitioners have to operate, they are having to operate through a different time. So, assessments are still taking place for child protection and safeguarding concerns; assessments are still taking place, and especially in relation to\u2014as you mentioned\u2014young carers, to support their needs. So, arrangements\u2014[Inaudible.] But they're having to be slightly differently done\u2014so, some of the technology, and keeping in contact and keeping those visits. So, we've used, for example, the St David's Day fund to make sure that care leavers are well supported in terms of having contact and are accessible and able to engage as well. So, we're having to be a little bit more\u2014and social services departments are having to be a little bit more\u2014innovative in the use of technology in the way that they've engaged as well. But personal visits are taking place, and visits especially, as the Minister mentioned earlier on\u2014they actually individually assess each case to determine the frequency of visits, to make sure that those contacts are maintained with children at a critical time."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. I don't want to take this much further, but personal visits and social distancing could be slightly problematic. I just want to finish with this one question, if I may. We've had recommendations from the Carers Trust, or Carers Trust Wales. Have they been accepted by Government, and is it those that are driving the agenda of the task and finish group that you announced the other day, Deputy Minister?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, those will certainly be considered by the task and finish group. I've had a letter from the Carers Trust about those issues, and we are setting up this group, as you know, and we will be looking at those issues in the group."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. Any steal on when that might report?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I don't have that at the moment."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Maybe we could have a note on that, Deputy Minister. Can I just say, we are running short of time? We did start late, so, if the Ministers are happy, we'll carry on until 2.10 p.m.\u20143.10 p.m.\u2014if that's okay. And the next questions are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "[Inaudible.]"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Hold on a sec, Si\u00e2n, we've lost translation again. Can we just see what can be done to get the translation back? Sorry, Si\u00e2n. Is there anyone who can help with the translation? There you go, Si\u00e2n. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "You will know, Deputy Minister\u2014because we have discussed this in private session\u2014my major concerns with regard to the childcare sector, and what kind of childcare sector we will have at the end of this crisis, as families start to return to the workplace. There are still some childcare providers who are falling between the cracks and aren't receiving financial support. Do you agree\u2014are there people who are still not being supported, and why isn't the Welsh Government able to provide that support for everyone in the childcare sector?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Thank you, Si\u00e2n, for that question. And I know that we have had a discussion about this before. Basically, we are aware that there are some sectors in the childcare sector that do fall through some of the loops. We have guaranteed that we will pay the money for the childcare offer for three months. So, that is guaranteed to them, and they are able to take advantage of the Government's job retainer scheme, but that does mean that there is a problem, as I think we've discussed before, of the double funding issue, and that is something that we have been trying to resolve and there have been discussions with the Treasury in Whitehall about ways forward on this. I'm going to ask Nicola to come in in a minute, because she's much more up to date with the discussions about that, but, so far, I don't think very much progress has been made on that. But we are looking to see if there are any other ways that we can get help to the childcare sector, and I'm actually following this meeting with a meeting with the Deputy Minister for equality and chief whip, who is responsible for the voluntary sector, because obviously many of the groups that we're talking about would come under the voluntary sector, because they have voluntary committees, but they fall between many stools, because they rent premises rather than own premises and they don't have high turnovers that would qualify them for some of these grants. So, perhaps I could ask Nicola to come in to expand on that."}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "Absolutely."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Briefly, if possible."}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "I'll try and be brief, because I'm conscious of time. So, some childcare settings can access funding under the small business rate relief scheme, but certainly not all of them; some of them can access funding under the economic resilience fund, and, as the Deputy Minister said, we're following up for some of them to be able to access funding under the third sector resilience funding. All of the childcare settings can apply for the UK Government's coronavirus job retention scheme, but there are some complications around that in that it's a salary-based scheme and you can't claim two types of public funding for the same individual member of staff. So, if you were using funding under the childcare offer to pay for a particular member of staff's salary, you can't access CJRS and furlough that individual with Government money as well, and that has led to some confusion and complication about how that balances, which we're trying to work through with the sector and with local authorities around the rules and regulations that the Treasury and HMRC have put in place around that. Alongside that, there's a whole range of different loans and services that are available. Some of those are less attractive to some childcare settings, but they are still available and Business Wales is offering support and advice for settings on how they can help weather this storm and support their workers as best they can. We're also having some conversations now with our economy colleagues and with Business Wales about what happens next, the recovery and the return of the sector, and we've just come out of a meeting with the childcare sector around the support they think they would need to have in place to be able to return from this as well. So, it's a topic that's very much live at the moment."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "I'm sure you can share my concerns and the concerns of Cwlwm, which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector, that there are a number of providers that aren't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this. What I can't understand is why you, in collaboration with the Minister for the economy, Ken Skates, can't devise a specific grant package for the providers that aren't currently receiving support, or we'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings won't be available to them. Why isn't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, that is what we're looking to see\u2014if we can get a bespoke scheme. I absolutely agree with you: it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going, because it is a fragile sector in any case, and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they've given for closing down is because they haven't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going. So, it is a very worrying situation. They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and, of course, with the social distancing and the lockdown, this has meant that we've had to discourage children from attending. So, that means the number of children they've had has been much reduced and it hasn't been viable for them to keep going, although obviously it's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go. But, I absolutely agree with what you're saying, Si\u00e2n, and we are looking for a solution, because we know it's vital not only for the children and their parents, but for the economy as well, that we do have that sector there, surviving after this is all over. So, I can assure you, we're working very hard, and I think Nicola's working day and night to try to achieve this."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And just finally from me, I'm very pleased that you are working on this, and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector, because it's been weeks now since all of this started, and if there's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them, then that needs to be dealt with. But just to conclude, how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "I think it's been crucial, because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they've been doing if it hadn't been for childcare for those who need it? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5, and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children, and so\u2014. I mean, that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter, so we don't have any particular statistics."}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "I do have some early numbers, if you'd like me to announce them?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes, that would be very good."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Very briefly."}, {"speaker": "Nicola Edwards", "content": "Yes. In terms of the provision in schools, we're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment. In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme, it has only been two weeks up and running really, so the numbers are quite low, but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week, and of those, just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children. So, it is picking up there; it was 900 children the week before that, so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay, thank you very much."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. And, can I just ask, in terms of the other vulnerable children, what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that? Is that happening in a uniform way?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Well, that is the intention\u2014that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology, and certainly, that is what is intended."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Suzy, very, very briefly, one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, please."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Just generally, have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the\u2014well, the child arrangement orders, the various versions of that?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Yes. In terms of the family courts, as you probably know, a lot of the hearings are going on virtually, but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date. So, that's one of the issues, really\u2014that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished. And obviously, the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders, which were his guidance, and obviously, this is directed at separated families subject to the family court, and that offers general advice to parents, recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different. And the Welsh Government has also provided guidance about staying at home and away from others. But of course, where parents have joint parental responsibility, as you know, the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households. With the other children, it's on a case-by-case basis, really, what actually happens. I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going, and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all; they're sending in any of their views virtually, but it appeared to be that there weren't any major issues arising."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you, and we have definitely now come to the end of our time. So, can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government, and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon, so thank you both to Ministers and officials. As usual, you will receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting. Diolch yn fawr."}, {"speaker": "Vaughan Gething AM", "content": "Diolch yn fawr, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Item 3, then. Can I propose, in accordance with Standing Order 17.42, that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Thank you very much. This is, of course, our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow, and it seems fitting that the National Assembly's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people, and I'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward. We are now going to proceed in private."}]}

Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice {gap} have it curved . And maybe like it's hand-shaped . Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons .

I think the main thing is we look at the costs ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah . But , thi i uh {disfmarker} This is with an L_C_D_ ? No ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Not with an L_C_D_ ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "not ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No , isn't ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel . If you don't {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Th then you'll see it on the television ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Hmm , yes . But then . Yeah , then you go one down one up . When you scroll ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . Yeah"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . Yeah So you may not be uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No . The television must do that . So {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm . Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room . And mostly they are smaller . So {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yes . But that won't be a problem . I think ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Most the times that are not advanced televisions ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No , but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} I got it on my screen and it was uh higher .

If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control .

It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends . {vocalsound} 'Cause if you don't , you won't sell . So , well how we did do that ? Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . Of course , well known for their uh trend {disfmarker} uh trends . And well , uh what did you find ? Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products . And um , material ? That should feel {disfmarker} have uh a spongy feeling . And to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it . Then the old and rich .

But we have s f {pause} for this kind of task , I would think , {pause} sort of a modest amount . I mean , a million frames actually isn't that much . We have a modest amount of {disfmarker} of uh training data from a couple different conditions , and then uh {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} yeah , that {disfmarker} and the real situation is that there 's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language , and noise type uh , and uh , {pause} uh , channel characteristic , sort of all over the map . A bunch of different dimensions . And so , I 'm just concerned that we don't really have {pause} um , the data to train up {disfmarker} I mean one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in {disfmarker} we still don't have a good explanation for this , but we are seeing that we 're adding in uh , a fe few different databases and uh the performance is getting worse and uh , when we just take one of those databases that 's a pretty good one , it actually is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is better . And uh that says to me , yes , that , you know , there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that . But one way or another {pause} we don't have uh , seemingly , the ability {pause} to represent , in the neural net of the size that we have , um , all of the variability {pause} that we 're gonna be covering . So that I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm hoping that um , this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making , which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets , uh , that uh if we {disfmarker} if they look at more constrained conditions they {disfmarker} they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them .

Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people {gap} have with them , always , like a phone . We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh {vocalsound} example of where to in be inspired . Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also {disfmarker} have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . I hope I'm going to try to help you on that . This is more risky because you're not following the trend ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So anyway uh next slide please . {vocalsound} Uh to be to be quick {vocalsound} there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are {disfmarker} uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very {disfmarker} pay much attention to . The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy . Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{gap}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see uh {vocalsound} it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Next slide please ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing .

So this is {disfmarker} The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . This is a mock - up of one . Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . Um . {comment} The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , and record it , and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting . So that 's my particular interest , is a portable device to do m uh , information retrieval on meetings . Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings . Um . So the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data . And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , as well as the close talking mikes . What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , gives us , um , high quality audio , um , especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus . So , for people who are more interested in language , we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available . And then also , um , it 's a very , very hard task in terms of speech recognition . Um . And so , uh , on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results . So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two . So that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time . And then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like , um , beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that . Our intention is to release this data to the public , um , probably through f through a body like the LDC . And , uh , just make it as a generally available corpus . Um . {vocalsound} There 's other work going on in meeting recording . So , we 're {disfmarker} we 're working with SRI , with UW , Um . NIST has started an effort which will include video . We 're not including video , obviously . And uh {disfmarker} and then also , um , a small amount of assistance from IBM . Is also involved . Um . Oh , and the digit strings , this is just a more constrained task . Um . So because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to {disfmarker} to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier . And it 's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits , which is a common connected digits corpus .

Um . We could pursue , um , if we thought it 's {disfmarker} it 's worth it but , uh , I think we {disfmarker} we will agree on that , um , to come up with a {disfmarker} with a sort of very , very first crude prototype , and do some implementation work , and do some {disfmarker} some research , and some modeling . So the idea is if you want to go somewhere , um , and focus on that object down {disfmarker} Oh , I can actually walk with this . This is nice . down here . That 's the Powder - Tower . Now , um , {vocalsound} we found in our , uh , data and from experiments , that there 's three things you can do . Um , you can walk this way , and come really , really close to it . And touch it . But you cannot enter or do anything else . Unless you 're interested in rock climbing , it won't do you no good standing there . It 's just a dark alley . But you can touch it . If you want to actually go up or into the tower , you have to go this way , and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth . If you actually want to see the tower , and that 's what actually most people want to do , is just have a good look of it , take a picture for the family , {comment} you have to go this way , and go up here . And there you have a vre really view {disfmarker} It exploded , the {disfmarker} during the Thirty years - war . Really uh , interesting sight . And um , these uh {disfmarker} these lines are , um , paths ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "or so That 's ab er , i the street network of our geographic information system . And you can tell that we deliberately cut out this part . Because otherwise we couldn't get our GIS system to take {disfmarker} to lead people this way . It would always use the closest point to the object , and then the tourists would be faced , you know , in front of a wall , but it would do them absolutely no good . So , {vocalsound} what we found interesting is , first of all , intentions differ . Maybe you want to enter a building . Maybe you want to see it , take a picture of it . Or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building . For whatever reason that may be ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "What 's it {disfmarker} what 's it made out of ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Um , r red limestone ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "So maybe you would wanna touch it ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Yeah , maybe you would want to touch it . Um . Okay , I {disfmarker} This , um {disfmarker} These intentions , we {disfmarker} w w we could , if we want to , call it the {disfmarker} the Vista mode , where we just want to {disfmarker} eh {disfmarker} s get the overview or look at it , the Enter mode , and the , well , Tango mode . I always come up with {disfmarker} with silly names . So this \" Tango \" means , literally translated , \" to touch \" . So {disfmarker} But sometimes the {disfmarker} the Tango mode is really relevant in the {disfmarker} in the sense that , um , if you want to , uh {disfmarker} If you don't have the intention of entering your building , but you know that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building . Consider , for example , the Post Office in Chicago , a building so large that it has its own zip code . So the entrance could be miles away from the closest point . So sometimes it m m m makes sense maybe to d to distinguish there . So , um , I 've looked , uh , through twenty some {disfmarker} Uh , I didn't look through all the data . um , and there {disfmarker} there 's uh , a lot more different ways in people {disfmarker} uh , the ways people phrase how to g get {disfmarker} if they want to get to a certain place . And sometimes here it 's b it 's a little bit more obvious {disfmarker} Um . {vocalsound} Maybe I should go back a couple of steps and go through the {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "No , OK come in , sit down .

OK , good ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "OK . It 's on ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "OK . That was the idea . Um , people , when they w when they want to go to a building , sometimes they just want to look at it . Sometimes they want to enter it . And sometimes they want to get really close to it . That 's something we found . It 's just a truism . And the places where you will lead them for these intentions are sometimes ex in incredibly different . I {disfmarker} I gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where {disfmarker} if you want to enter it . So , this is sort of how people may , uh {disfmarker} may phrase those requests to a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it . And we get tons of {disfmarker} of these \" how do I get to \" , \" I want to go to \" , but also , \" give me directions to \" , and \" I would like to see \" . And um , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a closer at the {disfmarker} the data {disfmarker} That was the wrong one . um , we can look at some factors that may make a difference . First of all , very important , and um , that {disfmarker} I 've completely forgot that when we talked . This is of course a crucial factor , \" what type of object is it ? \" So , some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of . Or very rarely . But you usually want to enter them . Some objects are more picturesque , and you {disfmarker} more f more highly photographed . Then of course the {disfmarker} the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants . Um . Sometimes I found in the {disfmarker} Uh , looking at the data , in a superficial way , I found some s sort of modifiers that {disfmarker} that m may also give us a hint , um , \" I 'm trying to get to \" Nuh ? \" I need to get to \" . Sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and {disfmarker} and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on . And this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered . That whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter influence the interpretation of {disfmarker} of a phrase . So , this is , uh , really uh , uh , uh {disfmarker} My suggestion is really simple . We start with , um {disfmarker} Now , Let me , uh , say one more thing . What we do know , is that the parser we use in the SmartKom system will never differentiate between any of these . So , basically all of these things will result in the same XML M - three - L structure . Sort of action \" go \" , and then an object ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Yeah ? and a source . So it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions . So , I thought , \" Mmm ! Maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . \" Where we can start it and n sort of look {disfmarker} \" OK , we need , we gonna get those M - three - L structures . The crude , undifferentiated parse . Interpreted input . We may need additional part of speech , or maybe just some information on the verb , and modifiers , auxiliaries . We 'll see . And I will try to {disfmarker} to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there , and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context . So this is not something which we can actually monitor , {vocalsound} now , but just is something we can set . And then you can all imagine sort of a {disfmarker} a constrained satisfaction program , depending on {disfmarker} on what , um , comes out . We want to have an {disfmarker} a structure resulting if we feed it through a belief - net or {disfmarker} or something along those lines . We 'd get an inferred intention , we {disfmarker} we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista , the Enter , and the , um , Tango mode . Which I think we maybe want to ignore . But . That 's my idea . It 's up for discussion . We can change all of it , any bit of it . Throw it all away ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Now @ @ this email that you sent , actually ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "What ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Now I remember the email ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Huh .

So we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "So , where exactly is the , uh , deeper understanding being done ? Like I mean , s is it before the Bayes - net ? Is it , uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "Well , it 's the {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's always all of it . So , in general it 's always going to be , the answer is , everywhere . Uh , so the notion is that , uh , this isn't real deep . But it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , uh , going to see some tourist thing . And , so that 's {disfmarker} that 's the quote \" deep \" that we 're trying to get at . And , Robert 's point is that the current front - end doesn't give you any way to {disfmarker} Not only doesn't it do it , but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it . It isn't like , if you just took what the front - end gives you , and used some clever inference algorithm on it , you would be able to figure out which of these is going on . So , uh , and this is {disfmarker} Bu - I in general it 's gonna be true of any kind of deep understanding , there 's gonna be contextual things , there 're gonna be linguistic things , there 're gonna be discourse things , and they gotta be combined . And , my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net , although it may turn out that t some totally different thing is gonna work better .

So the thing is , {vocalsound} i uh , d naively speaking , you 've {disfmarker} you 've got a {disfmarker} for this little task , a belief - net , which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things , that the person wants to {disfmarker} uh , to View it , to Enter it , or to Tango with it . Um . So that {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the output of the belief - net is pretty well formed . And , then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things . And , then the question is {disfmarker} there are two questions {disfmarker} is , uh , one , where do you get this i {comment} information from , and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ? So what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ? And you probably need intermediate nodes . I {disfmarker} we don't know what they are yet . So it may well be that , uh , for example , that , uh , knowing whether {disfmarker} Oh , another thing you want is some information abou I think , about the time of day .

Is there a construction , or the kind of object , or w uh , anything else that 's in the si It 's either in the {disfmarker} in the s the discourse itself or in the context . So if it turns out that , whatever it is , you want to know whether the person 's uh , a tourist or not , OK ? that becomes a feature . Now , how you determine that is another issue . But fo for the current problem , it would just be , \" OK , if you can be sure that it 's a tourist , versus a businessman , versus a native , \" or something , uh , that would give you a lot of discriminatory power and then just have a little section in your belief - net that said , \" pppt ! \" Though sin f in the short run , you 'd set them ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "and see ho how it worked , and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . From previous discourse or w any anything else you knew ."}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Right . So , how should {disfmarker} What 's the uh , plan ? Like , how should we go about figuring out these {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "OK . So , first of all is , uh , do e either of you guys , you got a favorite belief - net that you 've , you know , played with ? JavaBayes or something ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Oh . No , not really ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "OK . Well , anyway . f Get one . OK ? So {disfmarker} y so one of th one of the things we wanna do is actually , uh , pick a package , doesn't matter which one , uh , presumably one that 's got good interactive abilities , cuz a lot of what we 're gonna be d You know , we don't need the one that 'll solve massive , uh , belief - nets quickly . d w These are not gonna get big in {disfmarker} in the foreseeable future . But we do want one in which it 's easy to interact with and , uh , modify . Because i that 's {disfmarker} A lot of what it 's gonna be , is , um , playing with this . And probably one in which it 's easy to have , um , what amounts to transcript files . So that if {disfmarker} if we have all these cases {disfmarker} OK ? So we make up cases that have these features , OK , and then you 'd like to be able to say , \" OK , here 's a bunch of cases \" {disfmarker} There 're even ones tha that you can do learning OK ? So you have all their cases and {disfmarker} and their results and you have a {disfmarker} algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the {disfmarker} the probabilities for you . Um , probably that 's not worth it . I mean , my guess is we aren't gonna have enough data that 's good enough to make the {disfmarker} these data fitting ones worth it , but I don't know . So I would say you guy the first task for you two guys is to um , pick a package . OK , and you wanna it s You know , the standard things you want it stable , you want it {disfmarker} yeah , @ @ . And , as soon as we have one , we can start trying to , uh , make a first cut at what 's going on ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "An - Nuh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "But it {disfmarker} what I like about it is it 's very concrete . OK ? We {disfmarker} we have a {disfmarker} we know what the outcomes are gonna be , and we have some {disfmarker} some data that 's loose , we can use our own intuition , and see how hard it is , and , importantly , what intermediate nodes we think we need . So it {disfmarker} if it turns out that just , thinking about the problem , you come up with things you really need to {disfmarker} You know , this is the kind of thing that is , you know , an intermediate little piece in your belief - net . That 'd be really interesting ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "And it {disfmarker} and it may serve as a platform for a person , maybe me , or whoever , who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis .

And {disfmarker} and that altogether could also be {disfmarker} uh , become a nice paper that 's going to be published somewhere , if we sit down and write it . And um {disfmarker} When you said JavaBayes belief - net you were talking about ones that run on coffee ? or that are in the program language Java ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "No , th It turns out that there is a , uh {disfmarker} The new end of Java libraries .

M - three - L of course is XML . And the ontology that um , uh the student is {disfmarker} is constructing for me back in {disfmarker} in EML is in OIL and that 's also in XML .

It 's kind of blackboards and multi - wave blackboards and ways of interchanging and registering your a And so forth . So , that I don't think is even worth us worrying about just yet .

Something {disfmarker} something like , um , um {disfmarker} like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to {disfmarker} just to start off that way . And do some phone recognition . Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um {disfmarker} these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques . Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . Look at {disfmarker} then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category .

And we 'll do {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Oh . OK , sure . So , um , last week I finally got results from the SRI system about this mean subtraction approach . And , um , we {disfmarker} we got an improvement , uh , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , um , {vocalsound} six percent to four point five percent , um , on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F , but , um , the near - mike performance worsened , um , from one point two percent to two point four percent . And , um , wh why would that be , um , {vocalsound} considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ? And so , uh , with some input from , uh , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts . Um , first of all HTK {disfmarker} sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation , and so HTK wasn't . Um , so this , um {disfmarker} This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel {pause} normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case . And also , um , the {disfmarker} Andreas pointed out the SRI system is using more parameters . It 's got finer - grained acoustic models . So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts {pause} in the re - synthesized audio . Um . And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background . And so that seems like it could be difficult for training , cuz you could have {pause} different phones {pause} lined up with a different foreground phone , {vocalsound} um , {vocalsound} depending on {pause} the timing of the echo . So , um , I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set , and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them . So I 'm planning to use the Macrophone set of , um , read speech , and , um {disfmarker} Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "I had another thought just now , which is , uh , remember we were talking before about {disfmarker} we were talking in our meeting about , uh , this stuff that {disfmarker} some of the other stuff that Avendano did , where they were , um , getting rid of low - energy {pause} sections ? Um , uh , if you {disfmarker} if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in {pause} late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , uh , uh , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , uh , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a {disfmarker} an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum . So , what {disfmarker} what Hirsch did was , uh , set them to zero {disfmarker} set the negative values to zero . So if you imagine a {disfmarker} a waveform that 's all positive , which is the time trajectory of energy , um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in {disfmarker} So in this case you have some artificially imposed {pause} reverberation - like thing . I mean , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , uh , at n And , um , what if you did {disfmarker} ? I mean , there 's nothing to say that the {disfmarker} the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation . I mean , you also could , uh , just try to make it nicer ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some {disfmarker} some , uh , very low or {disfmarker} or near zero {pause} value .

He 's also putting in , uh , a {disfmarker} he 's taking out some reverberation , but he 's putting in something , because he has {pause} averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds , which are then being subtracted from the speech .

Yeah . There 're a few cases , actually , which I found later , that there are ."}, {"speaker": "PhD C", "content": "o Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "So that was one of the {pause} bugs that was there in estimating the noise . And , uh , so once it was cleared , uh , I ran a few experiments with {pause} different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and how t estimated the noise and , eh , smoothing the SNR also . And so the {disfmarker} the trend seems to be like , {vocalsound} uh , smoothing the {pause} current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the SNR , which is like {pause} deriving the Wiener filter , seems to be helping . Then updating it quite fast using a very small time constant . So we 'll have , like , a few results where the {disfmarker} estimating the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} More smoothing is helping . But still it 's like {disfmarker} it 's still comparable to the baseline . I haven't got anything beyond the baseline . But that 's , like , not using any Wiener filter . And , uh , so I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR . So there are three time constants that I have . So , I 'm just playing around . So , one is fixed in the line , like {pause} Smoothing the clean speech is {disfmarker} is helping , so I 'm not going to change it that much . But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying {disfmarker} trying a little bit . So , that h And the other thing is , like , putting a floor on the , uh , SNR , because that {disfmarker} if some {disfmarker} In some cases the clean speech is , like {disfmarker} when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values , so the SNR is , like , very low . And so that actually creates a lot of variance in the low - energy region of the speech . So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't {pause} vary a lot in the low - energy regions . And , uh . So . The results are , like {disfmarker} So far I 've been testing only with the {pause} baseline , which is {disfmarker} which doesn't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization . I just want to separate the {disfmarker} the contributions out . So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system , which is , uh , just the spectral {disfmarker} I mean , the mel sp mel , uh , frequency coefficients . Um . And the other thing that I tried was {disfmarker} but I just {vocalsound} took of those , uh , {pause} {vocalsound} Carlos filters , which Hynek had , to see whether it really h helps or not . I mean , it was just a {disfmarker} a run to see whether it really degrades or it helps . And it 's {disfmarker} it seems to be like it 's not {vocalsound} hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter which is nothing but a {pause} four hertz {disfmarker} a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum . So , that was the filter that Hy - uh , Carlos had . And so {disfmarker} Yeah . Just {disfmarker} just to see whether it really {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} is it worth trying or not . So , it doesn't seems to be degrading a lot on that . So there must be something that I can {disfmarker} that can be done with that type of noise compensation also , which {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I guess I would ask Carlos about that . I mean , how {disfmarker} how he derived those filters and {disfmarker} and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which {disfmarker} what we are using currently , or something like that . So maybe I 'll {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "This is cubic root of power spectra ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Yeah .

Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . {vocalsound} Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were {disfmarker} people are ready to pay for nice and look {disfmarker} and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in {disfmarker} and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it {disfmarker} the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using .

Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Two . Yeah , if {disfmarker} {gap} Sorry ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "You prefer it {gap} . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh {disfmarker} like digital calculators and electronic calculators . {vocalsound} So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . So we need to have some energy source to do what {disfmarker} to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . {vocalsound} And usually this {disfmarker} so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages {disfmarker} these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device {gap} remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are {disfmarker} I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you {disfmarker} can you make it on the whiteboard , or {disfmarker} mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface {gap} speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "so"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "On {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh train it , okay . Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "yeah , so that we just use simple recog"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} Too complex ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "no but but {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But uh very very good to sell . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . No , even in {disfmarker} you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "and ha ha you cannot use my remote control ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "because it's targeted to me . Whatever . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And what about the price of this component ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So {disfmarker} Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "It mm {disfmarker} okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Hmm . Cheap ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "because we want to have uh millions and in bulk ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Millions . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project

Designer", "content": "and we want to make really simple device"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Cheap ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "or or it will be something like volume , up , down ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Ye No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt {gap} volume and then {disfmarker} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "With a keywords and {disfmarker} yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and and because we can't really say user to say same wording"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Couple of words ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "then it become more mechanical and {disfmarker} yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay . {gap} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Of course uh it has to be {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "it's it it will be take care of our main {disfmarker} mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this {disfmarker} the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound} But then I think you you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "and and he's coming {disfmarker} you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No , in no not only speech , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "It's on top of using the button ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} I it's an option ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Well , I dunno . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this {gap} processor and {disfmarker} This really {gap} , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_

twelve point five Euros"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm why ?"},

This will be the first hybrid meeting of the committee. Some members will be participating via videoconference and some will be participating in person. This follows the order made by the House on May26,2020. Members who have already participated in a virtual meeting of the special committee may actually not notice any change, except for the fact that some members are also participating from the floor of the House. An additional rubric, that of statements by members, was also added to the proceedings of the committee. In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber, two screens have been set up in the chamber on either side of the Speakers chair. Sound amplification for virtual interventions will be available, and members in the chamber can listen to the floor sound or interpretation using the earpieces on their desks. Before speaking, please wait until I recognize you by name. Please also direct your remarks through the Chair. Thank you. For those of you joining via video conference, I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking. Also, please note that if you want to speak in English, you should be on the English channel. If you want to speak French, you should be on the French channel. Should you wish to alternate between the two languages, you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages. Should members participating by videoconference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times, they should activate their microphone and state that they have a point of order. Those in the chamber can simply rise in the usual way. Please note that today's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House. Next we'll move on to ministerial announcements. I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today, so we'll move on to petitions. We'll be presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions. For members participating in person, we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificates off at the table once the petitions are presented.

The petitioners call on this House to take note of the fact that Canada is the only country with a universal health care system that does not include the provision of necessary prescription medications. They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications. They call on the House assembled to put in place a system of universal national pharmacare, bringing down the cost of drugs through bulk purchasing. I think I'll call that a summary, Mr. Chair.

This Senate public bill, been put forward by Senator Salma Ataullahjan in the Senate, would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking. This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years, and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ harvesting and trafficking. The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7, particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C-7 to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada's euthanasia regime. Petitioners are not happy about the fact that the government is trying to eliminate the 10-day reflection period and remove other safeguards that only four short years ago the government thought were essential for the euthanasia and assisted suicide system that they were putting in place. The petitioners call on the government to address that, and they are not supportive of these particular efforts to remove vital safeguards from that regime.

This spring has been a difficult one for Nova Scotia and the communities of SackvillePrestonChezzetcook. While residents have banded together to tackle the challenges presented by COVID-19, we have also had to mourn the passing of three remarkable local women: RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, well known by many in Cole Harbour and the surrounding areas; our own Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough, who was based out of 12 Wing Shearwater; and Captain Jenn Casey of the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. All three women died in the line of duty in separate tragic events while serving our country. These three brave women, who served with honour on land, at sea and in the air, represent the absolute best of us. Heidi, Abbigail and Jenn were inspirational and will not be forgotten.

Canada needs a prime minister who will create jobs and opportunity, but instead we have a prime minister who is piling up crippling national debt. Yesterday the PBO predicted the federal deficit this year will hit over $252 billion. That is almost equivalent to an average year of government spending before the Liberal government. After five years with this debt, Prime Minister, Canada's national debt is set to hit $1 trillion, with almost nothing to show for it. Industries from coast to coast are either closed or are struggling. Canadian workers need and deserve a prime minister who supports our energy sector and gets our natural resources and agriculture products to market, who supports small business and will make our tax system encourage job creation and growth, and who will bring advanced manufacturing jobs to Canada and keep the automotive industry growing. Most importantly, we need a Conservative prime minister who will get the government finances under control after the massive debt left by this prime minister."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Next we'll go to Mr. Anandasangaree."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Gary Anandasangaree (ScarboroughRouge Park, Lib.)", "content": "Mr. Chair, I speak today with a very heavy heart. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, we've seen a disproportionate number of deaths in long-term care homes. I'm thankful for the Canadian Armed Forces who were deployed to the Altamont care home in my riding and four other facilities across the GTA. The CAF have brought forward horrifying allegations in the operation of these homes. They include residents being given expired or improper doses of medication; not being cleaned or changed for a prolonged period of time; being forcibly fed, causing choking; being bed-bound for weeks; receiving inadequate nutrition, and much more. Mr. Chair, I call upon Premier Ford to place these five homes under a mandatory management order and to appoint a third party manager to address and rectify these violations. I also call upon the Premier to undertake an independent public inquiry into the tragedy we face in long-term care facilities across Ontario. Finally, Mr. Chair, we need to work with the provinces and territories to set national standards of care for the most vulnerable in our society. We can and must do better.

They need us to plan for after the crisis, and we must do so now. To do so, we need the proper information. We need to know the status of the public finances. That is why the Bloc Qubcois is demanding that the government present an economic update, and that it do so before June17. This is not about making a spectacle. Everyone knows that the deficit will be huge. We had to provide the people with support and we all agree on that. But we have to know to what extent. We also have to know where we are starting from so that we can plan where we are going. This is about respecting the public, because they are the ones who will be paying the bill. In closing, I would like to remind the government that one group is not really contributing to the public purse at the moment. I am talking about the tech giants, the GAFAM group, that have never before been used to the extent that they are now, and that are still not paying a cent in tax in Canada. The Liberals promised to correct this injustice. Now is a great time for them to do so."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We'll now go to Ms. Sidhu."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Sonia Sidhu (Brampton South, Lib.)", "content": "Mr. Chair, this week is National Paramedic Services Week. I want to take this opportunity to thank the Peel region police, paramedic and firefighting services for keeping Bramptonians safe. In my riding, organizations have stepped up to help our community. Organizations such as the Khalsa Aid Society, the Interfaith Council of Peel, the Brampton YMCA, the Prayer Stone Peoples Church, Unity in the Community, Ste. Louise Outreach Centre, Knights Table, the Yogi Divine Society, Vraj Community Service, Regeneration Brampton and many more have made our community stronger during this difficult time.

Just in the last two months, we saw the largest production cut in Canadian history. Active rigs dropped by 92% and tens of thousands of oil and gas workers lost their jobs, adding to the 200,000 since 2015. Energy is Canada's biggest investor, and exporting could lead the recovery if there are actions, not just words. On March 25, the finance minister promised help in hours or days, not weeks, but he's letting Canadians down. Sixty-three days later, small oil and gas companies still can't apply for BDC loans, and last week's large employer loan terms are predatory, with interest rates escalating to 14% by year five. Those are payday loan rates. The required stock options being at record lows could make the government the largest shareholder. That's not emergency assistance; it's pandemic profiteering. Programs can't help workers if businesses can't or won't actually get the support.

They said that closing the borders wasn't necessary. They told us that wearing face masks wouldn't help. It is undeniable that the Liberal government has put Canadians in danger by silencing alternative points of view and has spread misinformation. Ironically, however, they have now gone ahead and crowned themselves the arbiters of truth. They are spending millions of dollars to censor what Canadians can and cannot say. They are determining what is true and what is not, what is right and what is wrong, what is in and what is out. When freedom of speech is repressed, it is safe to say that democracy is under siege.

In the early days of the pandemic and the lockdown that followed, Canadians were told by this government that programs would be rolled out very quickly and that gaps and shortcomings would be changed as time went on. While many Canadians are being let down by this government's response and its unnecessarily rigid programs, Conservatives identified solutions weeks ago, yet here we are, two and a half months later, and many of these programs still have not been improved. I have a simple question for the Prime Minister. On April 26 the Conservatives asked the Prime Minister to change the criteria for the Canada emergency business account so that small businesses that don't happen to have a business bank account could qualify for those types of programs. It's now May 27. Is the Prime Minister going to make that change?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister)", "content": "Mr. Chair, we knew from the beginning of this pandemic that we did need to move extremely quickly, and that's what we did. We rolled out the Canada emergency response benefit extremely quickly. Eight million Canadians have had that as a replacement for paycheques lost because of COVID-19. We also moved forward on the wage subsidy and a range of other programs to support workers and small businesses. What we've done in terms of helping small businesses with the Canada emergency business account has had a massive impact on small businesses across the country, but we understand that certain companies and businesses have particularities that mean it's a little more difficult for them to qualify. We are working with them through their regional development agencies, and we encourage them to approach their local RDAs, which will be able to help them get the money they deserve."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Andrew Scheer", "content": "Mr. Chair, these are very simple technical fixes that can be made by this government. There's no excuse for the delay. It's May 27. They've known about these problems for weeks. They're trying to get patted on the back for actions they took back in March, and yet they are letting so many Canadians down by not making these very simple changes. For example, companies that have acquired another company in the last year have employees whose jobs are threatened. The businesses are not allowed to qualify for the wage subsidy because their revenue is now counted together. We have identified this gap. Again, it's a simple question. Will companies that have acquired another company still be allowed to use the wage subsidy to keep workers on the job, yes or no?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon.

Andrew Scheer", "content": "It's actually a very simple fix. I can save him and his officials a lot of time. The government used the word amalgamation when it announced the changes to that program.

The government has set the parameters to qualify for the rent relief program for companies that have experienced a 70% revenue loss. There are untold thousands of businesses that have experienced a 50%, 55%, 60% or 65% loss that are ineligible but have no capacity to pay the rent. We called on the government weeks ago to have a more flexible sliding scale to allow more companies to access this program to keep more people on the job and more businesses open.

We will continue to work with the province to protect those living in long-term care facilities, and we continue to support them through the deployment of our outstanding Canadian Armed Forces and in our partnership with the Red Cross."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Don Davies", "content": "Mr. Chair, that's a shocking answer considering there's clear evidence of criminal conduct and negligence in this. That this federal government is not taking immediate steps to refer this to the nation's RCMP is unacceptable. The seniors care crisis is a national problem. COVID-19 has exposed critical vulnerabilities across Canada's entire network of long-term care facilities. Not a single province or territory currently meets the benchmark of 4.1 hours of hands-on care per day. As a result Canada has the worst record of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care among 14 comparable countries, with over 80% of Canadian fatalities occurring in these facilities. Will this government move swiftly to establish binding national standards for long-term care?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "Mr. Chair, the member opposite is exactly correct when he says that those who are hardest hit in terms of losing their lives and the negative effects of COVID are those who are living in long-term care homes. He's also correct when he indicates that COVID-19 has shown us what many of us have known for a long time, that we need to do better in long-term care and supports for seniors. As the member knows, we started those steps some four years ago or so when we began to make incredible investments in aging at home. We know that is one part of the solution, but we have to do better for those seniors who need a higher level of care. That's the work I'm doing now. I'm working with my colleagues at the provinces and territories to make sure that we come up with a solution that will truly result in better standards for all."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Don Davies", "content": "Mr. Chair, what we need is binding national standards, just like we set through the Canada Health Act in the health care sector generally. Gross fecal contamination, filthy medical equipment, insect infestations, ignoring patient cries for hourswe would never tolerate these conditions in Canada's hospitals. There's no reason to accept them in Canada's long-term care facilities. Will the minister move to bring long-term care facilities under the Canada Health Act, or similar legislation, with formal funds tied to acceptable standards of care for our seniors, just like we do for hospitals?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "Mr. Chair, the member shares the disgust and concern of so many Canadians across the country, not only those who have read the report but many of those who have struggled to provide care to elders in those long-term care homes, regardless of the province in which they live. We know we need to do better. We know that collectively, at all levels of government, we must do better for those people who cared for us and nurtured us all of those years.

Bill Blair", "content": "Again, I thank the member opposite for the opportunity to clarify. We have imposed very significant restrictions on non-essential travel, but of course there are circumstances where individuals come to this country and their entry into Canada is deemed essential.

My first question revolves around the lobster fishery. It's been open in Cape Breton since May 15, I believe. The weather has been good. The harvesters have been going at it every day.

We're working diligently to make sure we support the industry as best we can. We have made available over half a billion dollars to processors and harvesters to make sure they can weather this storm. We have made sure that the harvesters are able to access the harvester benefit as well as the grant, recognizing the unique nature of their business and how they are not able to access some of our other programs.

At this point, processors are being selective in what they're buying. They're not buying culls and other kinds of lobsters.

What can the fishermen expect, or what kinds of programs can they expect, if the season goes bust?"}, {"speaker": "Hon.

Patty Hajdu", "content": "Mr. Chair, we know that it is important to work with all of the provinces and territories under whose jurisdiction it falls to protect the seniors within those care homes. That's what we've been doing since the beginning of the outbreak of the coronavirus, and that's what we'll continue to do to protect the lives of seniors and strengthen their protection. We will, as I said, Mr. Chair, work with the provinces and territories to have a longer-term plan so that all seniors can age with dignity and safety."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Jenny Kwan", "content": "The government has a clear responsibility here. What is the government doing to ensure the standards of care in these Revera homes that they own?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "Mr. Chair, as I have repeatedly said, the jurisdiction for care of long-term care homes falls within the provincial and territorial realm. However, that being said, Mr. Chair, we have been there for provinces and territories since the outbreak of the coronavirus, and as the member opposite has clearly or likely heard the Prime Minister say, we will stand with provinces and territories as all elders have the right to age with dignity"}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "We go back to Ms. Kwan."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Jenny Kwan", "content": "I didn't hear an answer, Mr. Chair, so the answer is nothing, then. Do you think that the families of the seniors in these homes want to hear those excuses about jurisdictional issues? Does the minister not think that the families want to hear that the federal government is doing all it can to care for their parents?"}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "I would remind the members to direct their questions through the chair. The honourable minister."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chair. Quite frankly, I don't think that families care which level of government is responsible for caring for their elders. I think what they care about is that their elders are cared for. That's in fact what the Prime Minister believes. That's in fact what our government believes, and that's why we have willingly stepped up to say to provinces and territories that we will be there with you to make sure that all seniors in our lives have the right to age with dignity and care."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "We will now give the floor to Mrs.Gill, from the riding of Manicouagan. Go ahead, Mrs.Gill."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Marilne Gill (Manicouagan, BQ)", "content": "Mr.Chair, my question is for the Prime Minister who, earlier, clearly told us that the government's assistance is intended for those who are most in need and most vulnerable. I come from a riding where a lot of people make their living from the tourism industry. I don't know if the PrimeMinister read the newspapers yesterday, but in Quebec, losses to the tune of $4billion are expected until March2021 in the tourism accommodation sector alone. The service sector will lose 93,000jobs. How can I justify to my constituents the fact that a political party, which does not need it, has already seen money from the emergency wage subsidy, when people in my riding don't yet have access to it because of the seasonal nature of their work? These people haven't seen the money that is available through these programs."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "We think it is very important to protect the country's employees in all sectors of the economy. Through this approach, there will be more jobs after the pandemic, and the economic situation will be better. We will continue this approach."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Marilne Gill", "content": "Mr.Chair, this is the wrong approach. They are saying that they are protecting the jobs of the Liberal Party of Canada, which does not need the money. I'll ask a question similar to the previous one. Fishers in my riding did not qualify for the emergency wage subsidy. Another program was created for them, which isn't quite the same and doesn't really meet their needs. A government whose political wingnot the parliamentary wingdoesn't really need money takes money from the fund, but leaves fishers to make do with less generous programs that don't meet their needs. What do I tell the fishers in my riding?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr.Chair, we know that many sectors of the economy across the country are facing challenges. That's why we have adopted an approach with consistent criteria for all employees in all sectors. We have also introduced specific measures to help certain sectors, such as the fishing industry. We will continue our approach because we believe it's the best way to protect employees and our economy."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Marilne Gill", "content": "Mr.Chair, I'm still not satisfied. The government is saying that the best way to proceed is to give money to the political wing of the Liberal Party of Canada, when there are people who are getting nothing. What am I supposed to tell seasonal workers, who have absolutely no assurances for their future? I can't go back to my riding and say I'm proud of the work the government is doing or our efforts in the House. It's true, the House is closed right now. I forgot. I have a very hard time accepting that the government is helping employees of the Liberal Party in preparation for the next election campaign, when communities in my region are dying because their economies revolve around a single industry. I can't tell them I'm not ashamed of what's going on as we speak."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr.Chair, we felt it was necessary to put emergency programs in place in response to the crisis during the pandemic. That is our approach. The emergency wage subsidy is a program that is clearly meant to ensure employees are protected and maintain their relationship with their employer. As for the Canada emergency response benefit, it means a lot to people who don't have a job. We are going to stick to our approach, which is to use consistent criteria to help all employees and all Canadians around the country struggling in any sector of the economy."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Marilne Gill", "content": "Mr.Chair, I think the honourable Minister of Finance lives in an ivory tower. No, he is not protecting all jobs. No, he is not protecting all sectors of the economy. Once again, I will say that a party that doesn't need money has already received subsidies. However, people who need that money, people who are actually losing money or who don't know if they'll even be working this summer are getting zilch. There is absolutely no justifying that. I'd at least like to know whether the government is ashamed of what it's doing. When people have a conscience, eventually, they want to make up for their mistakes. Are the Liberals going to return that money? Is the finance minister going to help all sectors of the economy, including tourism, fisheries and seasonal industries?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr.Chair, I'd like to thank the member for her question. Our approach is based on consistent criteria. The emergency wage subsidy is meant for any sector of the economy where revenues have dropped by 30% or more. The measure is hugely important for organizations that are really struggling, because we can protect their workers. We are also providing the Canada emergency response benefit to other employees, meaning, those who have lost their income because of COVID-19. Consequently, we will keep up our approach to ensure we continue to fare as well as possible and the economy works well after the pandemic."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "Now we'll go to our last group of interventions, and that will be from Ms. Jansen in CloverdaleLangley City. Ms. Jansen, go ahead."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Tamara Jansen (CloverdaleLangley City, CPC)", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd like to begin with a shout-out to the brave waiters and waitresses at our local Earls restaurant and Browns Socialhouse, who have been opened again for on-site dining this week. Here in B.C. we're beginning to find our new normal, and it was great to see how small businesses have so quickly adapted their establishments to keep their workers and patrons safe while allowing people to get back to the business of living. You guys rock. Thanks for taking the lead. Mr. Chair, here in my riding I recently had contact with the mayor of Langley City who was wondering if I had any way of accessing personal protective gear, because our local firefighters were running out of stock. Then again yesterday, I spoke with one of our local homeless shelters that is also looking for PPE. Dr. Tam is telling all Canadians to wear masks in public, but I'm wondering if the Minister of Public Service and Procurement could tell us where exactly we're going to get all those masks with the current shortage."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Anita Anand", "content": "I want to be clear that our priority as a federal government has been to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE that goes to front-line health care workers. That is our priority, and we've been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets. We are now actively also exploring ways in which we can assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs, and that is something that I'll continue to update the House on as we go forward."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Tamara Jansen", "content": "A Globe and Mail article revealed that government orders for N95 masks have steadily been dropping. We've gone from over 200 million ordered to 100 million, according to a federal source. Mr. Chair, the number of N95 masks ordered, as reported on the department's website, does continue to fall. Will the minister tell us why we seem to continue to struggle to supply PPE to Canadians?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Anita Anand", "content": "It is no secret that we are in a global competition for N95 masks and other supplies, so the Government of Canada's approach is to diversify supply chains internationally and build up and retool domestic industry so that we can have these supplies going forward. In terms of the numbers on our web page, we have short-term and long-term contracts in place"}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "We go back to Ms. Jansen."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Tamara Jansen", "content": "Yes, I understand that a number of Chinese mask manufacturers have been nationalized, and products for Canadians have been confiscated by the CCP government. Is the drop in N95 orders due to, in actual fact, contracts being cancelled?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Anita Anand", "content": "On N95 masks, I would like to assure the member and the House that we have multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks, including with 3M in the United States, whose masks are crossing our border weekly over the next month."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Tamara Jansen", "content": "That didn't quite answer my question. Have any of our orders been cancelled by the nationalization of these manufacturers in China?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Anita Anand", "content": "We have an aide in place in China. We have our embassy and other firms actively ensuring that our supplies from the manufacturing source make their way to the warehouse. Over 40 flights have come to Canada with those masks and other supplies. Our supply chains are operating despite the global environment being highly competitive."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Tamara Jansen", "content": "We know many millions of N95 masks have arrived in Canada from China and have been substandard. What is the total number of substandard masks that have arrived?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Anita Anand", "content": "Mr. Chair, as previously explained to the House, about eight million masks did not meet spec by the Public Health Agency of Canada and have been repurposed to some extent in other areas of the system."}, {"speaker": "Mrs. Tamara Jansen", "content": "In a previous committee, the deputy minister advised us that Medicom was shoulder-tapped by the government to consider producing PPE. How many other companies did the government approach for this contract?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Anita Anand", "content": "We have operated in a very urgent way in order to procure supplies for front-line health care workers. We are now also moving to ensure that we have competitions run for the procurement of personal protective equipment. It's a multi-pronged approach, and our priority is to get supplies out to front-line health care workers in this time of crisis as quickly as possible. Thank you so much."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)", "content": "Just before we adjourn, I think this another mark of accomplishment on behalf of the great team here at the House of Commons. There have been some great efforts, even since yesterday evening, to get this turned around for today. My compliments to all members joining us here in the House and to all members who have joined by virtual conference. The committee is now adjourned until noon tomorrow. The meeting is adjourned."}]}
