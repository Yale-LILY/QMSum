The interaction between the hardware and the model had to be mediated through different techniques. Some members on the team were working on low-pass down-sampling as a replacement for LDA filters. Low-pass seemed to perform better, but the team was uncertain about its robustness. The professor thought that the team should submit something to Eurospeech and that they should further study reverberation. The professor thought that studying spectrograms would be a good place to start. The team then discussed VAD and line mean normalization as techniques for getting rid of noise. The meeting ended with a brief discussion on feature detection."
