            "content": "Yeah . So I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm still hopeful that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} I mean , we {disfmarker} we don't even know if the phase {vocalsound} is something {disfmarker} the average phase is something that we do want to remove . I mean , maybe there 's some deeper reason why it isn't the right thing to do . But , um , at least in principle it looks like there 's {disfmarker} there 's , uh , a couple potential ways to do it . One {disfmarker} one being to just work with the complex numbers , um , and , uh {disfmarker} in rectangular kind of coordinates . And the other is {vocalsound} to , uh , do a Taylor series {disfmarker} Well . So you work with the complex numbers and then when you get the spectrum {disfmarker} the average complex spectrum {disfmarker} um , actually divide it out , um , as opposed to taking the log and subtracting . So then , um , um , you know , there might be some numerical issues . We don't really know that . The other thing we talked a little bit about was Taylor series expansion . And , um , uh , actually I was talking to Dick Karp about it a little bit , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , since I got thinking about it , and {disfmarker} and , uh , so one thing is that y you 'd have to do , I think , uh {disfmarker} we may have to do this on a whiteboard , but I think you have to be a little careful about scaling the numbers that you 're {vocalsound} taking {disfmarker} the complex numbers that you 're taking the log of because {vocalsound} the Taylor expansion for it has , you know , a square and a cube , and {disfmarker} and so forth . And {disfmarker} and so if {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you have a {disfmarker} a number that is modulus , you know , uh , very different from one {disfmarker} {vocalsound} It should be right around one , if it 's {disfmarker} cuz it 's a expansion of log one {disfmarker} one minus epsilon or o is {disfmarker} is {vocalsound} one plus epsilon , or is it one plus {disfmarker} ?
